2. **Provides detailed reporting**:
   - Pass/fail status for each requirement
   - Actual timing measurements
   - Success rate calculation

3. **Automated validation during benchmark runs**

### Test Data Quality

The benchmarks use high-quality, realistic test data:

- **`SAMPLE_1K_TEXT`**: 1000+ character text about Einstein with rich entity content
- **`COMPLEX_RELATIONSHIP_TEXT`**: Text about Marie Curie with 10+ entities and relationships
- **`SIMPLE_QUESTIONS`**: 5 representative questions for QA testing
- **Sample triples**: 10 realistic knowledge triples for testing

### Benchmark Configuration

- **Measurement time**: 10 seconds per benchmark
- **Sample size**: 100 iterations for statistical significance
- **Warmup runs**: 3 iterations before measurement
- **Output**: HTML reports with detailed statistics

### Usage Instructions
