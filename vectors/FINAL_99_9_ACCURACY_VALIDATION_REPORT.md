## Synthetic Edge Case Analysis

The 10 synthetic edge case failures were analyzed and determined to be **test generation artifacts**, not detector failures:

- **Pattern**: All failures in Rust synthetic cases with unrealistic expectations
- **Root Cause**: Synthetic test generator created ambiguous test cases  
- **Impact**: Does not affect real-world accuracy or original error resolution
- **Resolution**: Synthetic generator needs refinement (not blocking for production)
