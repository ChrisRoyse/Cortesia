# Task 092: Define UnifiedSearchSystem Struct

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 091 completed: unified search module file created
- [ ] All required imports are in place
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Define the core struct that will coordinate between text search, vector search, and caching.

## Task Objective
Create the `UnifiedSearchSystem` struct with all required components.

## Steps
1. Add the UnifiedSearchSystem struct:
   ```rust
   /// Unified search system coordinating text and vector search
   pub struct UnifiedSearchSystem {
       /// Text search engine
       text_engine: Arc<TextSearchEngine>,
       /// Vector search store
       vector_store: Arc<VectorStore>,
       /// Memory efficient cache
       cache: Arc<RwLock<MemoryEfficientCache>>,
       /// Configuration
       config: UnifiedSearchConfig,
   }
   ```
2. Add struct documentation
3. Verify compilation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] UnifiedSearchSystem struct defined with all required fields
- [ ] Proper documentation comments added
- [ ] Uses Arc and RwLock for thread safety
- [ ] Compiles without errors

## Time: 3 minutes

## Next Task
Task 093 will define the configuration and search mode enums.

## Notes
This struct serves as the central coordination point for all search operations.
