# Task 108: Add Cache Integration Helpers

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 107 completed: cache warming methods implemented
- [ ] All cache async operations are functional
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Complete cache integration with final helpers for seamless search system integration.

## Task Objective
Add final integration helpers and verify complete cache system functionality.

## Steps
1. Update mod.rs to export async cache if needed:
   ```rust
   pub use cache::AsyncMemoryCache;
   ```
2. Verify all cache components work together:
   - AsyncMemoryCache wrapper
   - Serialization helpers
   - Cache warming functionality
   - Integration with search systems
3. Run final compilation check

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All cache components properly exported
- [ ] Async cache wrapper integrates with serialization helpers
- [ ] Cache warming works with async operations  
- [ ] Integration ready for search systems
- [ ] Compiles without errors

## Time: 2 minutes

## Next Task
Task 109 will begin cross-system consistency implementation.

## Notes
Complete cache integration enables seamless async caching for all search operations.
