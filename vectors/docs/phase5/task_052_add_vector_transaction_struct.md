# Task 052: Add Vector Transaction Struct

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 051 completed: TransactionOperation enum implemented
- [ ] Both TransactionState and TransactionOperation types exist
- [ ] Transaction infrastructure types compile correctly
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass with transaction enums)

## Context
Creating main transaction struct to hold state and operations.

## Task Objective
Define VectorTransaction struct with ID, state, operations fields.

## Steps
1. Open src/vector_store.rs
2. Add struct:
   ```rust
   pub struct VectorTransaction {
       pub id: String,
       pub state: TransactionState,
       pub operations: Vec<TransactionOperation>,
   }
   ```
3. Save file

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Struct with 3 basic fields added
- [ ] Uses defined transaction types
- [ ] File compiles

## Time: 3 minutes
