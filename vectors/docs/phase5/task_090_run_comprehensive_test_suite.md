# Task 090: Run Comprehensive Test Suite

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 089 completed: comprehensive rollback integration test added
- [ ] All test modules (001-089) implemented
- [ ] Vector search, error handling, transaction, and rollback tests complete
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Final validation of all implemented functionality through comprehensive testing.

## Task Objective
Execute complete test suite to verify all vector system functionality.

## Steps
1. Open terminal in project root
2. Run complete test suite:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
3. If any tests fail, run specific test modules:
   ```bash
   cargo test vector_search_tests
   cargo test error_handling_tests
   cargo test transaction_tests
   cargo test rollback_scenario_tests
   ```
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Check for any compilation warnings
6. Generate test coverage report if needed:
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --nocapture
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests compile successfully
- [ ] Vector search tests pass (cosine similarity, validation)
- [ ] Error handling tests pass (classification, context helpers)
- [ ] Transaction tests pass (state transitions, timeouts, operations)
- [ ] Rollback scenario tests pass (partial, timeout, error recovery, cascade, consistency)
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] Clean test output with success indicators

## Time: 8 minutes

## Next Task
Phase 5 micro-tasks complete! Ready for integration testing and deployment preparation.

## Notes
This completes tasks 061-090, covering:
- Vector Search (Tasks 061-069): Method signatures, configuration, similarity calculation, validation, basic implementation, and comprehensive tests
- Error Handling (Tasks 070-076): Comprehensive error types, context helpers, recovery strategies, classification, and retry mechanism tests
- Transaction Tests (Tasks 077-081): Infrastructure, state transitions, timeouts, operation tracking, and concurrent scenarios
- Rollback Scenarios (Tasks 082-090): Infrastructure, state validation, partial rollback, timeout handling, error recovery, cascade behavior, consistency checks, and comprehensive integration testing
