# Task 106: Create Consistency Module Foundation

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 105 completed: cache integration and async support added
- [ ] Unified search system is functional
- [ ] Vector store and text search systems exist
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Create foundation for cross-system consistency management to ensure data synchronization.

## Task Objective
Create the `src/consistency.rs` module with basic structures for consistency tracking.

## Steps
1. Create `src/consistency.rs` file with imports:
   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashMap;
   use std::sync::Arc;
   use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
   use tokio::sync::RwLock;
   use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
   use uuid::Uuid;
   ```
2. Add consistency state enum:
   ```rust
   /// Consistency state of a document across systems
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub enum ConsistencyState {
       /// All systems are synchronized
       Consistent,
       /// Systems are out of sync
       Inconsistent,
       /// Synchronization in progress
       Synchronizing,
       /// Synchronization failed
       Failed(String),
       /// Unknown state (needs checking)
       Unknown,
   }
   ```
3. Add document version tracking:
   ```rust
   /// Document version information across systems
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct DocumentVersion {
       /// Document ID
       pub id: String,
       /// Version in text search system
       pub text_version: Option<String>,
       /// Version in vector store
       pub vector_version: Option<String>,
       /// Version in cache
       pub cache_version: Option<String>,
       /// Last update timestamp
       pub last_updated: Instant,
       /// Consistency state
       pub state: ConsistencyState,
   }
   ```
4. Add consistency checker configuration:
   ```rust
   /// Configuration for consistency checking
   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
   pub struct ConsistencyConfig {
       /// Check interval in seconds
       pub check_interval: u64,
       /// Batch size for consistency checks
       pub batch_size: usize,
       /// Maximum age for version tracking
       pub max_version_age: Duration,
       /// Enable automatic repair
       pub auto_repair: bool,
   }
   
   impl Default for ConsistencyConfig {
       fn default() -> Self {
           Self {
               check_interval: 300, // 5 minutes
               batch_size: 100,
               max_version_age: Duration::from_secs(24 * 3600), // 24 hours
               auto_repair: true,
           }
       }
   }
   ```
5. Verify compilation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `src/consistency.rs` file created with proper imports
- [ ] ConsistencyState enum covers all possible states
- [ ] DocumentVersion tracks versions across all systems
- [ ] ConsistencyConfig with reasonable defaults
- [ ] Timestamp tracking for version age management
- [ ] Compiles without errors

## Time: 4 minutes

## Next Task
Task 107 will implement the main ConsistencyManager struct.

## Notes
Consistency foundation provides state tracking and version management across text search, vector store, and cache systems.
