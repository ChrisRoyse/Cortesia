# Task 006: Add or Update Tokio Dependency

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 005 completed: tokio dependency status verified
- [ ] Cargo.toml inspection results documented
- [ ] Know whether tokio exists and its current configuration
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should indicate tokio status)

## Context
Based on Task 005 findings, add tokio if missing or update to include "full" features.

## Task Objective
Ensure tokio dependency has full features: `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }`

## Steps
1. Open Cargo.toml in editor
2. If tokio doesn't exist: Add `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }`
3. If tokio exists but lacks features: Update to include `features = ["full"]`
4. Save file

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Tokio dependency present with `features = ["full"]`
- [ ] Version is "1.0" or compatible
- [ ] File saves successfully
