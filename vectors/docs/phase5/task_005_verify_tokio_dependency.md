# Task 005: Verify Tokio Dependency Exists

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 004 completed: base arrow dependency added
- [ ] All Arrow dependencies are in Cargo.toml
- [ ] Cargo.toml file is accessible for inspection
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should show arrow dependency resolution)

## Context
LanceDB requires async runtime. Need to check if tokio is already present in Cargo.toml.

## Task Objective
Verify that tokio dependency exists in Cargo.toml with "full" features

## Steps
1. Open Cargo.toml in editor
2. Search for "tokio" in [dependencies] section
3. Check if it includes `features = ["full"]`
4. Note findings for next task

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Located tokio dependency (or confirmed it doesn't exist)
- [ ] Checked if it has `features = ["full"]`
- [ ] Ready to add/update in next task if needed

## Time: 3 minutes
