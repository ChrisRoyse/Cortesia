# Task 156: Add OptimizationSummary Struct

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 155 completed: performance history getter added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add OptimizationSummary struct to provide comprehensive optimization system status.

## Task Objective
Define OptimizationSummary struct to encapsulate optimization system metrics and status.

## Steps
1. Add OptimizationSummary struct to vector_store.rs:
   ```rust
   /// Query optimization summary
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct OptimizationSummary {
       /// Total queries analyzed
       pub total_queries_analyzed: usize,
       /// Number of unique query patterns
       pub unique_query_patterns: usize,
       /// Number of patterns with optimization recommendations
       pub optimized_patterns: usize,
       /// Average response time across all queries
       pub avg_response_time: f64,
       /// Overall success rate
       pub overall_success_rate: f64,
       /// Whether optimization is enabled
       pub optimization_enabled: bool,
       /// Last analysis timestamp
       pub last_analysis: Instant,
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] OptimizationSummary struct added with all required fields
- [ ] Proper derives including Serialize and Deserialize
- [ ] Compiles without errors
