# Task 146: Add Analyze Query Performance Method Signature

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 145 completed: query hashing method added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add method signature for analyzing and recording query performance data.

## Task Objective
Implement analyze_query_performance method signature and basic structure.

## Steps
1. Add analyze_query_performance method to QueryOptimizer impl block:
   ```rust
   /// Analyze query performance and update patterns
   pub async fn analyze_query_performance(
       &self,
       query: &str,
       search_mode: &str,
       response_time: f64,
       result_count: usize,
       success: bool,
       relevance_score: Option<f64>,
   ) {
       let query_hash = self.hash_query(query);
       
       // Create performance record
       let record = QueryPerformanceRecord {
           query_hash: query_hash.clone(),
           search_mode: search_mode.to_string(),
           response_time,
           result_count,
           relevance_score,
           timestamp: Instant::now(),
           success,
       };
       
       // TODO: Add record to history and update patterns
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] analyze_query_performance method signature added
- [ ] Performance record creation implemented
- [ ] Compiles without errors
