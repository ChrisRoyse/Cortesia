# Task 145: Add Query Hashing Method

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 144 completed: cache optimization strategy added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add method to hash queries for pattern recognition and deduplication.

## Task Objective
Implement hash_query method to generate consistent hashes for query pattern analysis.

## Steps
1. Add hash_query method to QueryOptimizer impl block:
   ```rust
   /// Hash query for pattern matching
   fn hash_query(&self, query: &str) -> String {
       // Simplified hash - actual implementation would use proper hashing
       format!("query_{}", query.len())
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] hash_query method added with basic hashing logic
- [ ] Method returns consistent string hash for queries
- [ ] Compiles without errors

## Time: 2 minutes
