# Task 107: Add Record Repair Operation Method

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 106 completed: RepairHistoryEntry struct added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add method to ConsistencyManager for recording repair operations in history.

## Task Objective
Implement record_repair_operation method for tracking repair attempts.

## Steps
1. Add record repair operation method to ConsistencyManager:
   ```rust
   impl ConsistencyManager {
       /// Record repair operation in history
       pub async fn record_repair_operation(
           &self,
           operation: RepairOperation,
           result: RepairResult,
           duration_ms: u64,
       ) {
           // Implementation would add to repair_history
           // For now, we'll just track basic metrics
           println!("Repair recorded: {} - Success: {}", operation.doc_id, result.success);
       }
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Record repair operation method added
- [ ] Proper method signature
- [ ] Basic logging included
- [ ] Compiles without errors
