# Task 050: Add Transaction State Enum

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 049 completed: Embedding error type added
- [ ] src/vector_store.rs compiles without errors
- [ ] All error types are defined and working
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass with embedding functionality)

## Context
Starting transaction infrastructure with state tracking.

## Task Objective
Define TransactionState enum with 5 basic states.

## Steps
1. Open src/vector_store.rs
2. Add enum:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
   pub enum TransactionState {
       None,
       Active,
       Committed,
       RolledBack,
       Failed(String),
   }
   ```
3. Save file

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Enum with 5 variants added
- [ ] Derives Debug, Clone, PartialEq
- [ ] File compiles

## Time: 3 minutes
