# Task 140: Add QueryOptimizer Struct

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 139 completed: OptimizerConfig Default implementation added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add the main QueryOptimizer struct that orchestrates query optimization and performance tuning.

## Task Objective
Define the QueryOptimizer struct to manage query patterns, performance history, and optimization strategies.

## Steps
1. Add QueryOptimizer struct to vector_store.rs:
   ```rust
   /// Query optimization and performance tuning system
   pub struct QueryOptimizer {
       /// Performance monitor reference
       performance_monitor: Arc<PerformanceMonitor>,
       /// Query analysis cache
       query_patterns: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, QueryPattern>>>,
       /// Optimization strategies
       strategies: Vec<OptimizationStrategy>,
       /// Configuration
       config: OptimizerConfig,
       /// Performance history
       performance_history: Arc<RwLock<Vec<QueryPerformanceRecord>>>,
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QueryOptimizer struct added with all required fields
- [ ] Proper use of Arc and RwLock for concurrent access
- [ ] Compiles without errors
