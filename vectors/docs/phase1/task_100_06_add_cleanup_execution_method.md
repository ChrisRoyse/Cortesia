# Task 100_06: Add Cleanup Execution Method

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 100_05 completed: Signal waiting methods added
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add the core cleanup execution method that runs all registered cleanup tasks in priority order.

## Task Objective
Implement execute_cleanup method with error handling and progress logging.

## Steps
1. Add cleanup execution method to ShutdownHandler:
   ```rust
   impl ShutdownHandler {
       async fn execute_cleanup(&self) {
           let tasks = self.cleanup_tasks.read().await;
           let total_tasks = tasks.len();
           
           info!("Executing {} cleanup tasks", total_tasks);
           
           for (index, task) in tasks.iter().enumerate() {
               info!("Cleanup [{}/{}]: {}", index + 1, total_tasks, task.name);
               
               match (task.cleanup_fn)() {
                   Ok(_) => info!("✓ Cleanup completed: {}", task.name),
                   Err(e) => error!("✗ Cleanup failed for {}: {}", task.name, e),
               }
           }
           
           info!("All cleanup tasks completed");
       }
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Cleanup execution method implemented
- [ ] Progress tracking and logging included
- [ ] Error handling without abort
- [ ] Compiles without errors
