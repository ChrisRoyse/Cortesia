# 100/100 Completion Plan: Final 8 Points

## Current State: 92/100
**Remaining Gap:** 8 points across 3 criteria

## Test-Driven Subtask Breakdown

### Subtask Group A: Verification Enhancement (4 points)
**Goal:** Add specific failure recovery to ALL tasks

#### A1: Verification Template Creation (30 min)
- **Test:** Can an AI recover from 5 common failure scenarios?
- **Implementation:** Create standard verification template with:
  - Network failure recovery
  - Permission error handling
  - Missing dependency resolution
  - Compilation error fixes
  - Test failure debugging

#### A2: Apply Verification to Tasks 1-50 (2 hours)
- **Test:** Each task has 3+ specific failure scenarios
- **Implementation:** Update 50 tasks with enhanced verification

#### A3: Apply Verification to Tasks 51-100 (2 hours)
- **Test:** Each task has troubleshooting section
- **Implementation:** Update 50 tasks with recovery procedures

#### A4: Apply Verification to Tasks 101-136 (1 hour)
- **Test:** All decomposed tasks have failure handling
- **Implementation:** Update remaining 36 tasks

### Subtask Group B: Task Detail Completion (2 points)
**Goal:** Replace ALL template tasks with full implementations

#### B1: Identify Template Tasks (30 min)
- **Test:** List all tasks still using generic templates
- **Implementation:** Scan tasks 1-136 for placeholders

#### B2: Rewrite Template Tasks Batch 1 (2 hours)
- **Test:** First 20 template tasks have complete code
- **Implementation:** Full rewrites following proven format

#### B3: Rewrite Template Tasks Batch 2 (2 hours)
- **Test:** Remaining template tasks have complete code
- **Implementation:** Full rewrites with all imports

### Subtask Group C: 10-Minute Feasibility Refinement (2 points)
**Goal:** Ensure ALL tasks truly completable in 10 minutes

#### C1: Time Validation Audit (1 hour)
- **Test:** Measure actual completion time for 10 sample tasks
- **Implementation:** Execute tasks, record times, identify outliers

#### C2: Rebalance Complex Tasks (1 hour)
- **Test:** No task exceeds 10 minutes
- **Implementation:** Further decompose any complex tasks

#### C3: Consolidate Simple Tasks (30 min)
- **Test:** No task under 5 minutes (too simple)
- **Implementation:** Combine overly simple subtasks

## Subagent Deployment Strategy

### Parallel Subagent Assignment

**Subagent V1: Verification Specialist**
```
Mission: Add failure recovery to all tasks
Input: Current tasks lacking specific troubleshooting
Output: Enhanced tasks with 3+ failure scenarios each
Success Criteria: 
- Network failures handled
- Permission errors resolved
- Missing dependencies addressed
- Clear recovery steps provided
```

**Subagent D1: Detail Completer**
```
Mission: Replace all template tasks with full implementations
Input: List of template-based tasks
Output: Complete rewrites with working code
Success Criteria:
- All imports included
- No placeholders or stubs
- Exact file paths specified
- Code is runnable
```

**Subagent F1: Feasibility Validator**
```
Mission: Ensure 10-minute completion for all tasks
Input: Current task set
Output: Rebalanced tasks all completable in 10 minutes
Success Criteria:
- No task over 10 minutes
- No task under 5 minutes
- Proper 2-6-2 structure
- Time-validated execution
```

## Verification Strategy (Following TDD)

### RED Phase - Write Failing Tests
1. **Test 1:** Can an AI with zero knowledge complete any random task in 10 minutes?
2. **Test 2:** Does every task have specific failure recovery procedures?
3. **Test 3:** Are all tasks free of template placeholders?

### GREEN Phase - Make Tests Pass
1. Deploy subagents to fix identified gaps
2. Apply enhancements systematically
3. Validate each improvement

### REFACTOR Phase - Optimize
1. Consolidate common patterns
2. Ensure consistency across all tasks
3. Final quality validation

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: After Verification Enhancement (4 points gained)
- Score should be: 96/100
- All tasks have failure recovery
- Troubleshooting sections complete

### Checkpoint 2: After Detail Completion (2 points gained)
- Score should be: 98/100
- No template tasks remain
- All code is complete and runnable

### Checkpoint 3: After Feasibility Refinement (2 points gained)
- Score should be: 100/100
- All tasks validated at 10 minutes
- Perfect execution proven

## Iteration Protocol (Per CLAUDE.md)

If any checkpoint scores < target:
1. **Document Gap:** Specify exact deficiency
2. **Spawn Fix Subagent:** Target the specific issue
3. **Write New Test:** Reproduce the problem
4. **Implement Fix:** Address root cause
5. **Re-verify:** Confirm improvement
6. **Continue Until 100/100**

## Success Validation

### Final 100/100 Criteria
- [ ] 136 tasks all follow exact format
- [ ] Every task has 3+ failure scenarios
- [ ] All tasks time-validated at 10 minutes
- [ ] No templates or placeholders exist
- [ ] Zero-knowledge AI can execute any task
- [ ] Special characters ([workspace], Result<T,E>) proven working
- [ ] Windows compatibility verified
- [ ] Production quality achieved

## Estimated Timeline

**Total Time:** 12-15 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Verification Enhancement: 5.5 hours
- Detail Completion: 4.5 hours
- Feasibility Refinement: 2.5 hours
- Quality Validation: 1.5 hours
- Final Testing: 1 hour

## Next Action

Deploy the three parallel subagents (V1, D1, F1) to begin systematic completion of the remaining 8 points.
