# Phase 1 Micro-Tasks: Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
Phase 1 has been broken down into **103 micro-tasks**, each designed to be completed in 10 minutes or less. These tasks build upon each other to create a production-ready Tantivy-based text search system with special character support and AST-based chunking.

## Task Organization

### Foundation & Setup (Tasks 1-10)
- Project structure and dependencies
- Tantivy schema configuration
- Basic test framework

### Core Chunking System (Tasks 11-30)
- AST-based boundary detection
- Semantic chunk preservation
- Overlap handling
- Multi-language support

### Indexing Implementation (Tasks 31-50)
- Document indexer
- Metadata enrichment
- Performance optimizations
- Memory management

### Search Engine (Tasks 51-70)
- Query parsing with special characters
- Result ranking and highlighting
- Caching and optimization
- Search execution pipeline

### Testing & Validation (Tasks 71-90)
- Integration testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Edge case handling

### Production Features (Tasks 91-103)
- System integration verification
- Monitoring and telemetry
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Graceful shutdown
- Distributed locking
- Backup and restore
- Complete execution guide

## How to Use These Tasks

### For AI Coding Assistants

Each task file provides:
1. **Objective**: Clear single goal
2. **Context**: Full understanding of the system
3. **Task Details**: Exact implementation steps
4. **Success Criteria**: Measurable completion checks
5. **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid
6. **Next Task Context**: How it connects

### Execution Order

Tasks should be completed in numerical order. Each stage has validation checkpoints:

```
Stage 1 (Tasks 1-10) → Checkpoint → 
Stage 2 (Tasks 11-30) → Checkpoint →
Stage 3 (Tasks 31-50) → Checkpoint →
Stage 4 (Tasks 51-70) → Checkpoint →
Stage 5 (Tasks 71-90) → Checkpoint →
Stage 6 (Tasks 91-103) → Final Validation
```

### Quality Assurance Protocol

For each task:
1. Complete implementation
2. Run tests
3. Self-assess (score 1-100)
4. If < 100, iterate until perfect
5. Move to next task only when current scores 100/100

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Special Character Support
- `[workspace]`, `Result<T,E>`, `#[derive]`
- `&mut`, `->`, `::`
- All special characters searchable

### 2. AST-Based Smart Chunking
- Respects code boundaries
- Semantic completeness
- Configurable overlap
- Multi-language support

### 3. Production Ready
- Health checks
- Monitoring/metrics
- Graceful shutdown
- Distributed locking
- Backup/restore

### 4. Performance Targets
- Search: < 10ms latency
- Indexing: > 500 docs/sec
- Memory: < 200MB for 10K docs
- File size: up to 10MB

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Build project
cargo build --release

# Run all tests
cargo test --all

# Run specific stage tests
cargo test --test stage1_tests
cargo test --test stage2_tests
# ... etc

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Check Windows compatibility
cargo test --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Run complete validation
cargo test --test phase1_validation
```

## Success Metrics

✅ **Completed when:**
- All 103 tasks implemented
- All tests passing (100%)
- Performance targets met
- Windows compatibility verified
- Production features operational

## Troubleshooting

See Task 103 for complete troubleshooting guide covering:
- Tantivy index issues
- Memory optimization
- Special character problems
- Windows path handling
- Performance tuning

## Next Steps

After completing all Phase 1 tasks:
1. Run complete validation suite
2. Document any deviations
3. Tag release as `phase1-complete`
4. Proceed to Phase 2 (Boolean Logic)

## Task Execution Time Estimate

- 103 tasks × 10 minutes = 1,030 minutes
- Approximately 17 hours of focused work
- Recommended: Complete over 2-3 days

## Support

Each task is self-contained with full context. AI assistants can execute any task independently without requiring knowledge of other tasks.
