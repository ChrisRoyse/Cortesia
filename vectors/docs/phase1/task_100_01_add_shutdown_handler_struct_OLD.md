# Task 100_01: Add ShutdownHandler Struct

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Task 99 completed: Health checks implemented
- [ ] Run: `cargo check` (should pass)

## Context
Add the core ShutdownHandler struct with shutdown signaling capability.

## Task Objective
Define the ShutdownHandler struct with basic atomic shutdown state management.

## Steps
1. Add ShutdownHandler struct to shutdown.rs:
   ```rust
   use std::sync::Arc;
   use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
   use tokio::sync::RwLock;
   use anyhow::Result;
   use tracing::{info, warn, error};
   
   pub struct ShutdownHandler {
       shutdown_requested: Arc<AtomicBool>,
       cleanup_tasks: Arc<RwLock<Vec<CleanupTask>>>,
   }
   ```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ShutdownHandler struct added with required fields
- [ ] Proper imports included
- [ ] Compiles without errors
