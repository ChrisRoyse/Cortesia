# Task 00a: Create Empty Types File Structure

**Estimated Time: 3 minutes**
**Lines of Code: 5**
**Prerequisites: None**

## Context

Phase 3 tasks require a `types.rs` module but assume it exists. This task creates the empty file structure that subsequent tasks will build upon.

## Your Task

Create the minimal `src/types.rs` file with just the module comment.

## Required Implementation

Create `src/types.rs` with exactly this content:

```rust
//! Minimal type definitions for Phase 3 tasks
//! 
//! This module will contain the core types used throughout the vector search system.
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File `src/types.rs` exists
- [ ] Contains exactly the module comment shown above
- [ ] File compiles without errors when checked
- [ ] Ready for SearchResult struct to be added

## Validation

Run `cargo check` - should compile without errors.

## Next Task

Task 00b will add the SearchResult struct to this file.
