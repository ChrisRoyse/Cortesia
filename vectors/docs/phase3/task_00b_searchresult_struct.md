# Task 00b: Add SearchResult Struct with Basic Fields

**Estimated Time: 8 minutes**
**Lines of Code: 25**
**Prerequisites: Task 00a completed**

## Context

Phase 3 tasks assume a `SearchResult` struct exists with specific fields. This task adds the struct definition with all required fields.

## Your Task

Add the SearchResult struct to `src/types.rs` with all required fields and derives.

## Required Implementation

Add this struct to `src/types.rs`:

```rust
/// Basic search result structure - minimal implementation
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct SearchResult {
    /// Path to the file containing the match
    pub file_path: String,
    
    /// The content that matched the search query
    pub content: String,
    
    /// Index of the chunk within the file
    pub chunk_index: u64,
    
    /// Relevance score of this result
    pub score: f32,
    
    /// Language detected for this file/chunk
    pub language: String,
    
    /// Start byte position of the chunk
    pub start_byte: u64,
    
    /// End byte position of the chunk
    pub end_byte: u64,
    
    /// Whether this chunk has overlap with adjacent chunks
    pub has_overlap: bool,
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] SearchResult struct added to `src/types.rs`
- [ ] All 8 required fields present with correct types
- [ ] Proper derives: Debug, Clone, PartialEq
- [ ] Documentation comments for struct and all fields
- [ ] File compiles without errors

## Validation

Run `cargo check` - should compile without errors.

## Next Task

Task 00c will add constructor methods to SearchResult.
