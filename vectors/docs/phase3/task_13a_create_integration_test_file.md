# Task 13a: Create Integration Test File

**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**  
**Lines of Code: ~10**
**Prerequisites: task_00_6_integration_test_foundation.md**

## Context
You are creating the basic integration test file structure for testing the complete vector search pipeline. This task establishes the test framework that subsequent tasks will build upon to validate end-to-end functionality from document indexing through search operations.

## Your Task
Create the integration test file with basic setup and test framework structure.

## Required Implementation
Add this integration test module to the existing `crates/vector-search/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod integration_tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::fs;
    use tempfile::TempDir;
    use tokio_test;
    
    /// Create a test workspace with sample files for integration testing
    fn create_test_workspace(temp_dir: &TempDir) -> Result<()> {
        // Implementation will be added in subsequent tasks
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration test module added to lib.rs
- [ ] Basic imports and structure in place
- [ ] Test helper function skeleton created
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Ready for subsequent test implementations

## Validation
Run `cargo check -p vector-search` - should compile successfully.

## Next Task
Task 13b will implement basic engine integration tests that verify the core indexing and search functionality.
