# Vector Indexing System - Rust Master Plan

## Overview
Production-ready vector indexing system using Rust, Tantivy, and LanceDB to achieve TRUE 100% accuracy on all query types with enterprise performance and Windows compatibility.

## Strategic Approach: Use Proven Libraries

### Why Rust + Tantivy + LanceDB Wins
We completely abandoned the Python approach and adopted proven, battle-tested libraries:

1. **Tantivy**: Solves ALL text search problems (special chars, boolean logic, proximity, wildcards)
2. **LanceDB**: Solves ALL vector search problems (ACID transactions, performance, Windows compatibility) 
3. **Rayon**: Solves ALL parallelism problems (no GIL, works perfectly on Windows)
4. **Tree-sitter**: Solves ALL semantic chunking problems (AST-based boundaries)

### What We Abandoned (Python Problems)
1. **FTS5 Limitations**: Replaced with Tantivy's proven special character handling
2. **ChromaDB Issues**: Replaced with LanceDB's ACID transactions
3. **Multiprocessing Failures**: Replaced with Rayon's zero-cost parallelism  
4. **Custom Boolean Logic**: Replaced with Tantivy's QueryParser
5. **Manual Proximity**: Replaced with Tantivy's NEAR operator
6. **Windows Incompatibility**: Rust works perfectly on Windows

## System Requirements

### Core Requirements ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE
1. **100% Special Character Support**: `[workspace]`, `Result<T, E>`, `->`• `&mut`, `##`, `#[derive]` ← Tantivy designed to handle natively
2. **True Boolean Logic**: AND/OR/NOT with proper precedence ← Tantivy QueryParser
3. **Accurate Proximity Search**: NEAR/N with real distance calculation ← Tantivy built-in
4. **Exact Phrase Matching**: Quotes match exact sequences ← Tantivy phrase queries
5. **Wildcard Support**: `*` and `?` patterns ← Tantivy wildcard queries
6. **Performance target**: <50ms query time (based on Tantivy benchmarks)
7. **Scale**: 100,000+ files with linear CPU scaling ← Rayon parallelism
8. **Windows First**: Above all else, must work on Windows ← Rust guarantee

## Architecture Design

### Core Components (Proven Libraries)
1. **Text Index**: Tantivy (battle-tested, special characters work)
2. **Vector Store**: LanceDB (ACID transactions, Windows compatible)
3. **Smart Chunker**: Tree-sitter (AST-based semantic boundaries)
4. **Query Engine**: Tantivy QueryParser (supports all query types)
5. **Parallel Processor**: Rayon (zero-cost, Windows perfect)
6. **Unified Search**: Hybrid text + vector with result fusion
7. **Transaction Manager**: LanceDB ACID (solves consistency problems)
