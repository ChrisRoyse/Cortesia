# Micro-Task 079: Setup Test Data Directory Structure

## Objective
Create the directory structure for organizing test data files for vector search system validation.

## Context
Test data needs to be organized by type and pattern for systematic testing. This structure will hold all generated test files that will validate the system's handling of special characters, particularly in code patterns like brackets [], generics <>, operators ->, and macros #[derive].

## Prerequisites
- Task 078 completed (Architecture documentation complete)
- data directory exists in project root

## Time Estimate
5 minutes

## Instructions
1. Navigate to data directory: `cd data`
2. Create test_files directory: `mkdir test_files`
3. Navigate to test_files: `cd test_files`
4. Create subdirectories:
   ```cmd
   mkdir basic_text
   mkdir code_samples
   mkdir rust_patterns
   mkdir generic_types
   mkdir bracket_patterns
   mkdir operator_patterns
   mkdir macro_patterns
   mkdir mixed_patterns
   mkdir large_files
   mkdir edge_cases
   ```
5. Create index file `test_data_index.txt`:
   ```
   Test Data Organization for Vector Search System:
   Created: %DATE% %TIME%
   
   Directory Structure:
   - basic_text/: Plain text samples for baseline testing
   - code_samples/: Code files with various special characters
   - rust_patterns/: Rust language-specific patterns
   - generic_types/: Generic type patterns (Result<T, E>, Vec<String>)
   - bracket_patterns/: Various bracket combinations [workspace], [dependencies]
   - operator_patterns/: Operator sequences (->>, ->, ::, etc.)
   - macro_patterns/: Rust macro patterns (#[derive], #[cfg])
   - mixed_patterns/: Complex combinations of special characters
   - large_files/: Performance testing with large datasets
   - edge_cases/: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
   
   Windows Compatibility Notes:
   - All paths use backslash separators
   - UTF-8 encoding with BOM considerations
   - Special character handling in filenames
   ```
6. Return to root: `cd ..\..`
7. Commit changes: `git add data\test_files && git commit -m "task_079: Create test data directory structure"`

## Expected Output
- Organized directory structure for test data
- Index file documenting organization
- Windows-compatible path structure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 10 subdirectories created
- [ ] Index file created with descriptions
- [ ] Windows path compatibility verified
- [ ] Structure committed to Git

## Validation Commands
```cmd
dir data\test_files
type data\test_files\test_data_index.txt
```

## Next Task
task_080_create_test_data_manifest.md

## Notes
- Ensure all directories are accessible with Windows paths
- Index file serves as documentation for future tasks
- Structure supports systematic test data generation
