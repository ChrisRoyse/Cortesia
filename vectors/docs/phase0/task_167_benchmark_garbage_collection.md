# Micro-Task 167: Benchmark Garbage Collection

## Objective
Measure Rust's memory management performance and allocation/deallocation patterns.

## Prerequisites
- Task 166 completed (Memory fragmentation measured)

## Time Estimate
7 minutes

## Instructions
1. Create GC benchmark `bench_memory_management.rs`
2. Test allocation/deallocation cycles
3. Measure memory pressure impact
4. Run: `cargo run --release --bin bench_memory_management`
5. Commit: `git add src/bin/bench_memory_management.rs && git commit -m "Benchmark memory management patterns"`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory management benchmark created
- [ ] Allocation cycles measured
- [ ] Memory pressure quantified
- [ ] Results committed
