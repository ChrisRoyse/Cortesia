# Micro-Task 003: Install Required Rust Components

## Objective
Install necessary Rust toolchain components for the vector search system development.

## Context
The vector search system requires specific Rust components including clippy for linting, rustfmt for formatting, and potentially WASM targets for future browser compatibility.

## Prerequisites
- Task 001 completed (Rust installation verified)
- Task 002 completed (Windows tools verified)

## Time Estimate
7 minutes

## Instructions
1. Install clippy: `rustup component add clippy`
2. Install rustfmt: `rustup component add rustfmt`
3. Add WASM target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
4. Verify installations:
   - `cargo clippy --version`
   - `cargo fmt --version`
   - `rustup target list | findstr wasm32-unknown-unknown`

## Expected Output
- Clippy installed and working
- Rustfmt installed and working
- WASM target available
- All components verified

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `cargo clippy --version` shows version
- [ ] `cargo fmt --version` shows version
- [ ] WASM target shows as "installed" in target list
- [ ] No installation errors occurred
