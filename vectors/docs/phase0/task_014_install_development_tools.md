# Micro-Task 014: Install Development Tools

## Objective
Install additional development tools for code quality, testing, and performance analysis.

## Context
Beyond the basic Rust toolchain, we need specialized tools for benchmarking (criterion), coverage analysis, and code quality. This task installs these tools globally for use across all crates.

## Prerequisites
- Task 013 completed (Workspace compilation verified)
- Internet connection for tool installation
- Cargo package manager working

## Time Estimate
9 minutes

## Instructions
1. Install cargo-watch for auto-recompilation: `cargo install cargo-watch`
2. Install cargo-criterion for benchmarking: `cargo install cargo-criterion`
3. Install cargo-tarpaulin for coverage (Windows): `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`
4. Install cargo-expand for macro debugging: `cargo install cargo-expand`
5. Verify installations:
   - `cargo watch --version`
   - `cargo criterion --version`
   - `cargo tarpaulin --version`
   - `cargo expand --version`
6. Document installed versions in `development_tools.txt`

## Expected Output
- All development tools installed successfully
- Tool versions documented
- Tools ready for use in development workflow

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `cargo watch` installed and working
- [ ] `cargo criterion` installed and working
- [ ] `cargo tarpaulin` installed and working
- [ ] `cargo expand` installed and working
- [ ] All tool versions documented in file
