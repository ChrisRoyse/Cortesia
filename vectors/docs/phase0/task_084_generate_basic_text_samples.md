# Micro-Task 084: Generate Basic Text Samples

## Objective
Generate plain text files with various content patterns to establish baseline performance for the vector search system.

## Context
Basic text samples provide a control group for testing vector search functionality without the complexity of special characters. These files help establish performance baselines and validate core indexing capabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Task 083 completed (File generation templates created)

## Time Estimate
8 minutes

## Instructions
1. Navigate to test data directory: `cd data\test_files`
2. Create generation script `generate_basic_text.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   Introduction
   This document describes the basic functionality of a vector search system.
   The system indexes documents and provides similarity-based retrieval.
   
   Features
   - Document indexing
   - Similarity search
   - Result ranking
   - Performance optimization
   
   Usage
   To use the system, first index your documents.
   Then submit search queries to find relevant content.
   Results are returned in order of relevance.
   
   Performance
   The system handles large document collections efficiently.
   Indexing speed depends on document size and content complexity.
   Search queries typically complete in milliseconds.
   
   Troubleshooting
   Common issues include memory usage and disk space.
   Monitor system resources during large indexing operations.
   Consider batch processing for very large document sets."""

       qa_text = """Frequently Asked Questions
   
   What is a vector search system?
   A vector search system converts documents into numerical vectors and finds similar content using mathematical distance calculations.
   
   How does indexing work?
   The system processes documents, extracts features, converts them to vectors, and stores them in an optimized index structure.
   
   What makes searches fast?
   Efficient vector indexing algorithms and approximate nearest neighbor techniques enable quick similarity calculations.
   
   Can the system handle large datasets?
   Yes, the system is designed to scale with distributed indexing and parallel processing capabilities.
   
   What file formats are supported?
   The system supports text files, documents, code files, and structured data formats.
   
   How accurate are the search results?
   Accuracy depends on the quality of vector representations and the similarity between query and document content.
   
   Is there a query size limit?
   Queries should be reasonably sized for optimal performance, typically under 1000 words.
   
   How often should indexes be updated?
   Update frequency depends on how often your content changes and how fresh results need to be."""
