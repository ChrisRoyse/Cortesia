# Micro-Task 170: Measure Branch Prediction

## Objective
Analyze branch prediction impact on conditional code paths in search algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- Task 169 completed (SIMD operations benchmarked)

## Time Estimate
8 minutes

## Instructions
1. Create branch prediction test `measure_branch_prediction.rs`
2. Test predictable vs unpredictable branches
3. Measure conditional performance impact
4. Run: `cargo run --release --bin measure_branch_prediction`
5. Commit: `git add src/bin/measure_branch_prediction.rs && git commit -m "Measure branch prediction impact on performance"`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Branch prediction measurement created
- [ ] Predictable vs unpredictable tested
- [ ] Performance impact quantified
- [ ] Results committed
