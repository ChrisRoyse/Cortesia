# Micro-Task 001: Verify Rust Installation

## Objective
Verify that Rust toolchain is properly installed with correct version for Windows development.

## Context
This is the first step in setting up the development environment for the vector search system. We need Rust 1.70+ for compatibility with modern async features and Windows-specific optimizations.

## Prerequisites
- None (this is the first task)

## Time Estimate
5 minutes

## Instructions
1. Check Rust version: `rustc --version`
2. Verify version is 1.70.0 or higher
3. Check Cargo version: `cargo --version`
4. Verify rustup is installed: `rustup --version`
5. Document versions in a file called `rust_versions.txt`
6. Verify workspace dependencies are properly configured
7. Add comprehensive Cargo.toml dependencies for vector search

## Required Workspace Dependencies
The following dependencies must be added to the workspace Cargo.toml to support the vector search system:

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
# Core dependencies (already present)
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full", "tracing"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
uuid = { version = "1.7", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
tracing = "0.1"

# Vector search and text processing dependencies
tantivy = "0.24"                 # Full-text search engine
tree-sitter = "0.20"             # AST parsing for code
tree-sitter-rust = "0.20"        # Rust language support
tree-sitter-python = "0.20"      # Python language support
walkdir = "2.4"                  # Directory traversal
regex = "1.10"                   # Regular expressions

# Testing dependencies
tokio-test = "0.4"
tempfile = "3.8"
```

## Dependency Verification Steps
1. Run `cargo check` to verify all dependencies resolve correctly
2. Test compilation of the vector-search crate: `cargo check -p vector-search`
3. Ensure no dependency conflicts exist

## Expected Output
- Rust version 1.70.0+ confirmed
- Cargo version confirmed
- `rust_versions.txt` file created with version information

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `rustc --version` returns 1.70.0 or higher
- [ ] `cargo --version` executes without error
- [ ] `rustup --version` executes without error
- [ ] Version information documented
- [ ] All workspace dependencies are properly configured
- [ ] `cargo check` executes successfully
- [ ] `cargo check -p vector-search` compiles without errors
- [ ] No dependency version conflicts detected
