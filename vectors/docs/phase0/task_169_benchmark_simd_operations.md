# Micro-Task 169: Benchmark SIMD Operations

## Objective
Benchmark SIMD vector operations vs scalar implementations for performance comparison.

## Prerequisites
- Task 168 completed (CPU cache performance profiled)

## Time Estimate
9 minutes

## Instructions
1. Create SIMD benchmark `bench_simd_operations.rs`
2. Compare SIMD vs scalar dot products
3. Test vector addition performance
4. Run: `cargo run --release --bin bench_simd_operations`
5. Commit: `git add src/bin/bench_simd_operations.rs && git commit -m "Benchmark SIMD vs scalar vector operations"`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SIMD benchmark created
- [ ] SIMD vs scalar compared
- [ ] Performance gains measured
- [ ] Results committed
