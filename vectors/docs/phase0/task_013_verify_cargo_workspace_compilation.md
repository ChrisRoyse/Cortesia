# Micro-Task 013: Verify Cargo Workspace Compilation

## Objective
Test that the Cargo workspace configuration compiles correctly before adding member crates.

## Context
Before creating individual crates, we need to ensure the workspace configuration itself is valid. This prevents issues when we start adding member crates in subsequent tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Task 012 completed (Data directories created)
- Cargo workspace configured
- All previous environment setup completed

## Time Estimate
6 minutes

## Instructions
1. Run workspace check: `cargo check --workspace`
2. Verify no TOML syntax errors are reported
3. Check workspace metadata: `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1`
4. Verify workspace members list is empty (since no crates exist yet)
5. Test workspace-level commands work:
   - `cargo tree` (should show empty)
   - `cargo workspace version` (if available)
6. Document any warnings or issues found

## Expected Output
- Workspace configuration validated
- No syntax errors in Cargo.toml
- Workspace commands working correctly
- Ready for member crate creation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `cargo check --workspace` completes without errors
- [ ] `cargo metadata` returns valid JSON
- [ ] No TOML syntax errors reported
- [ ] Workspace commands execute properly
- [ ] Configuration ready for member crates
