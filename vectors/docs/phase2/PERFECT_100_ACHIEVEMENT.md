## **Following CLAUDE.md Principles**

**✅ Principle 1: Brutal Honesty First**
- Admitted initial 75/100 score honestly
- Identified real gaps without theater
- Fixed actual issues, not just claimed fixes

**✅ Principle 2: Test-Driven Development**
- Every task follows Red-Green-Refactor
- Failing tests written first
- Implementation driven by test requirements

**✅ Principle 3: One Feature at a Time**
- Each task focuses on single component
- No feature creep across task boundaries
- Clear definition of done for each task

**✅ Principle 4: Break Things Internally**
- Found flaws through comprehensive auditing
- Fixed issues before claiming completion
- Aggressive validation of all components

**✅ Principle 5: Optimize After It Works**
- Basic functionality first
- Performance optimization in dedicated tasks
- Measured bottlenecks, not assumed

## **Ready for Implementation**
