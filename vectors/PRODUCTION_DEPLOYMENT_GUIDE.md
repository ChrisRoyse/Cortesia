## Operational Procedures

### **Daily Operations**

#### **Health Checks**
```bash
# System health validation
python -c "
from smart_chunker_optimized import SmartChunkerOptimized
chunker = SmartChunkerOptimized()
test_result = chunker._chunk_content_optimized('def test(): pass', 'python', 'health_check.py')
