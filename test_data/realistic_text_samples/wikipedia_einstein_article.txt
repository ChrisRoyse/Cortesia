Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc², which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy. This work is thought to have been so extraordinarily influential that it has been called the foundation of modern physics.

From 1909, Einstein taught at various universities, and in 1913, he came to Berlin, where he remained until 1933. In Berlin, he served as the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (1914–1932) and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin (1914–1933). In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, being Jewish, did not return to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.

On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. Later, with the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons.

Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". His face is one of the most recognizable in the world. In 1999, he was named "Person of the Century" by Time magazine. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time, with Newton coming in second. His revolutionary scientific ideas transformed fundamental concepts in physics, including space, time, matter, energy, and gravity.

Einstein's legacy extends beyond his scientific contributions. He was also a philosopher of science and a public intellectual who often spoke out on issues of civil rights, academic freedom, and world peace. His humanitarian efforts and moral stance against racism and war have inspired generations. Today, Einstein's theories continue to be essential to our understanding of the universe, from GPS satellite navigation to modern cosmology and the study of black holes.

The Einstein field equations, which form the core of general relativity, describe how matter and energy determine the curvature of spacetime. These equations have been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, including the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations. Einstein's prediction of these ripples in spacetime, made over a century ago, was finally confirmed in 2015, marking one of the greatest triumphs in modern physics.

Einstein's work on unified field theory, though unsuccessful in his lifetime, laid the groundwork for modern attempts to find a "theory of everything" that would unite all the fundamental forces of nature. His famous quote, "God does not play dice with the universe," reflects his deep-seated belief in the deterministic nature of physical laws, even as quantum mechanics suggested otherwise.

Throughout his career, Einstein maintained a childlike curiosity about the natural world, famously saying, "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." This approach to scientific inquiry, combined with his extraordinary mathematical intuition, allowed him to revolutionize our understanding of reality itself.

Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at Princeton Hospital in New Jersey, United States, at the age of 76. He remains an icon of intellectual achievement and scientific progress, inspiring countless researchers, students, and curious minds around the world to continue exploring the mysteries of the universe.
