## Implementation Timeline

The project is divided into 12 phases (Phase 0-11), with an estimated 60-day implementation timeline:

- **Days 1-3**: Foundation & Architecture
- **Days 4-7**: MCP Integration
- **Days 8-12**: Core Dashboard
- **Days 13-17**: MCP Tool Catalog
- **Days 18-23**: Data Flow Visualization
- **Days 24-28**: System Architecture
- **Days 29-34**: Performance Monitoring
- **Days 35-39**: Storage Monitoring
- **Days 40-45**: Cognitive Patterns
- **Days 46-51**: Debugging Tools
- **Days 52-55**: Code Integration
- **Days 56-60**: Polish & Optimization

## Getting Started

1. Review the `MASTER_PLAN.md` for the overall strategy
2. Start with `Phase_00_Foundation_Architecture.md` to set up the development environment
3. Follow each phase sequentially, as they build upon each other
4. Each phase includes:
   - Detailed objectives
   - Technical implementation guide
   - Code examples
   - Testing procedures
   - Deliverables checklist

## Unique Aspects

This dashboard is specifically designed for LLMKG's unique architecture:

- **No Traditional REST API**: Works with MCP protocol instead
- **No Traditional Database**: Visualizes custom memory-mapped storage
- **Brain-Inspired Design**: Reflects cognitive architecture patterns
- **LLM-Optimized**: Shows how the system optimizes for AI/LLM usage
- **High Performance**: Handles sub-millisecond operations

## Development Workflow

1. **Phase Implementation**: Follow each phase documentation
2. **Component Development**: Build reusable visualization components
3. **Integration**: Connect components to LLMKG via MCP bridge
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs from code

## Success Criteria

- Complete visibility into all MCP tools and operations
- Real-time performance with <100ms update latency
- Interactive testing of all system components
- Intuitive UX requiring minimal documentation
- Zero impact on LLMKG core performance

## Next Steps

Begin with Phase 0 to establish the foundation. Each phase documentation contains everything needed for implementation, including code examples, architectural decisions, and testing procedures.
