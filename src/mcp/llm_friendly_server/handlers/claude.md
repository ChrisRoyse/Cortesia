async fn handle_*(
    knowledge_engine: &Arc<RwLock<KnowledgeEngine>>,
    usage_stats: &Arc<RwLock<UsageStats>>,
    params: Value,
) -> std::result::Result<(Value, String, Vec<String>), String>
```

### Response Format
Handlers return a tuple containing:
1. **Data** (`Value`): Structured JSON response data
2. **Message** (`String`): Human-readable description
3. **Suggestions** (`Vec<String>`): Actionable recommendations

### Error Handling
