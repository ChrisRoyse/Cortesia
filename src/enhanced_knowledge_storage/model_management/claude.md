# Directory Overview: Model Management System

## 1. High-Level Summary

The `model_management` directory implements a comprehensive resource-constrained model management system for small language models. This system provides intelligent model selection, LRU caching, asynchronous loading with retry logic, and memory-aware resource management. It's designed to efficiently handle multiple AI models in memory-limited environments while providing optimal model selection based on task complexity.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Language:** Rust
- **Async Runtime:** Tokio
- **Concurrency:** std::sync (Arc, Mutex), tokio::sync (RwLock, Mutex)
- **Serialization:** serde (JSON)
- **Logging:** tracing ecosystem (structured logging)
- **Error Handling:** thiserror
- **Model Storage:** Local filesystem (model_weights directory)
- **Testing:** Built-in Rust testing framework with tokio::test

## 3. Directory Structure

The directory contains 5 core modules that work together to provide model management:
