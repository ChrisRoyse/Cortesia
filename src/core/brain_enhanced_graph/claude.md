    ├── KnowledgeGraph (core storage)
    ├── SDRStorage (sparse representations)
    ├── Entity Activations (neural states)
    ├── Synaptic Weights (connection strengths)
    └── Concept Structures (formed concepts)

Entity Operations → Update Activations → Propagation → Concept Formation
Query Operations → Attention Focus → Activation Search → Ranked Results
Learning Operations → Weight Updates → Statistics → Optimization
```

## 7. Performance Considerations

* **Async Operations:** All state modifications use async RwLock for concurrent access
* **Caching:** Query results cached for repeated access patterns
* **Lazy Evaluation:** Activation propagation uses thresholds to limit computation
* **Memory Efficiency:** SDR storage for sparse representations
* **Batch Operations:** Bulk updates for activation and weight changes

## 8. Usage Patterns

### Basic Entity Management
```rust
// Insert entity with brain features
let entity_key = graph.insert_brain_entity(id, entity_data).await?;

// Update activation
graph.set_entity_activation(entity_key, 0.8).await;

// Propagate activation
let result = graph.propagate_activation_from_entity(entity_key, 0.9).await?;
```

### Cognitive Queries
```rust
// Perform neural-inspired search
let query_result = graph.cognitive_query(&query_embedding, top_k).await?;

// Get entities by activation
let active_entities = graph.get_entities_above_threshold(0.5).await;
```

### Concept Operations
```rust
// Form concepts automatically
graph.trigger_concept_formation(seed_entity).await?;

// Get concept statistics
let stats = graph.get_concept_statistics().await;
```

## 9. Configuration Guide

The module supports multiple configuration profiles:

* **Default:** Balanced for general use
* **Testing:** Lower thresholds, faster processing
* **High Performance:** Optimized for speed, some features disabled
* **Exploratory:** Higher spread, more concept formation

Key parameters to tune:
* `learning_rate`: Speed of weight adaptation (0.0-1.0)
* `activation_threshold`: Minimum activation to process (0.0-1.0)
* `max_activation_spread`: Propagation depth limit
* `concept_coherence_threshold`: Minimum coherence for concepts
