# Directory Overview: Adaptive Learning System

## 1. High-Level Summary

The `adaptive_learning` directory contains a comprehensive adaptive learning system that integrates with cognitive systems to continuously improve performance based on feedback and system monitoring. This system implements a closed-loop learning architecture that can automatically detect performance issues, collect user/system feedback, and execute targeted adaptations to improve overall system performance.

The system operates through continuous learning cycles that collect metrics, analyze performance bottlenecks, correlate performance with user satisfaction, identify learning targets, and execute adaptations. It also supports emergency adaptation for critical system failures and includes sophisticated task scheduling and resource management.
