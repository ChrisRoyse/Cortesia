    Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a theoretical physicist who developed 
    the theory of relativity. His famous equation E=mcÂ² revolutionized our 
    understanding of energy and mass. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 
    Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect.
    
    His theories led to numerous technological advances including GPS satellites,
    which must account for relativistic effects to maintain accuracy.
