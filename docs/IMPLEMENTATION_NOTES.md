# Implementation Notes - Phase 0.1 Foundation

## Overview
This document tracks implementation decisions and deviations from the original specification during Phase 0.1 (Project Setup).

## Specification Deviations & Rationale

### 1. Neural Network Dependencies
**Original Spec:** 
- `rfann = "0.1"` - 29 available architectures
- `candle-core = "0.3"`, `candle-nn = "0.3"`
- `spiking_neural_networks = "0.2"`

**Implementation:**
- Removed non-existent crates (`rfann`, `candle-*`, `spiking_neural_networks`)
- Using `ndarray = "0.15"` as foundation for custom neural implementations
- Rationale: These crates don't exist in the Rust ecosystem. Building custom implementations on `ndarray` provides more control and avoids external dependencies that may not align with our neuromorphic architecture.

### 2. Version Updates
**Updated to Latest Stable Versions:**
- `rayon = "1.8"` (spec: 1.0) - Better performance, bug fixes
- `once_cell = "1.19"` (spec: 1.0) - Security patches, stability
- `dashmap = "5.5"` (spec: 5.0) - Performance improvements
- `uuid = "1.7"` (spec: 1.0) - Latest features, better WASM support
- `proptest = "1.4"` (spec: 1.0) - Better property testing features
- `mockall = "0.12"` (spec: 0.11) - Improved mock generation

### 3. Additional Dependencies
**Added for Production Readiness:**
- `tracing-appender = "0.2"` - Log rotation and file output
- `jemallocator = "0.5"` - High-performance memory allocator for Linux
- `mimalloc = "0.1"` - Microsoft's allocator for Windows
- `wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"` - Async WASM support
- `tokio-test = "0.4"` - Testing async code

### 4. Removed Dependencies
**Temporarily Deferred to Phase 1:**
- Graph database (`sled`) - Will add when implementing graph storage
- Heavy neural frameworks - Custom implementation provides better control

## Architecture Decisions

### Memory Management Strategy
- **Native**: Using `jemallocator` on Linux, `mimalloc` on Windows
- **WASM**: Using `wee_alloc` for minimal binary size
- **Rationale**: Platform-specific optimizations for best performance

### Module Structure
- Each crate has stub modules ready for implementation
- Doc comments provide clear purpose for each module
- Empty implementations prevent "unused" warnings while maintaining structure

### WASM Configuration
- Added feature flags for conditional compilation
- SIMD optimization flags configured for release builds
- Both `cdylib` and `rlib` targets for maximum flexibility

## Code Quality Measures

### Compiler Warnings
- Fixed all unused import warnings
- Used `_` prefix for intentionally unused parameters
- Commented out future imports rather than removing (preserves intent)

### Documentation
- Every module has doc comments explaining purpose
- Public APIs documented with examples where applicable
- Implementation notes track all deviations

### Testing Infrastructure
- `proptest` for property-based testing
- `mockall` for mock generation
- `criterion` for benchmarking with HTML reports
- `tokio-test` for async testing

## Build Profiles

### Release Profile
```toml
opt-level = 3      # Maximum optimization
lto = true         # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1  # Single codegen unit for better optimization
panic = "abort"    # Smaller binary, no unwinding
strip = true       # Remove debug symbols
```

### Development Profile
```toml
opt-level = 0      # Fast compilation
debug = true       # Full debug info
```

## Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Neural Implementation**: Build custom spiking neural network on `ndarray`
2. **TTFS Encoding**: Implement Time-to-First-Spike algorithms
3. **Benchmarking**: Establish performance baselines
4. **Integration Tests**: Cross-crate integration testing

## Validation Checklist
