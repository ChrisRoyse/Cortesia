# Cognitive Processing and Reasoning Systems

## Overview

The LLMKG system implements a sophisticated cognitive processing framework that simulates human-like reasoning patterns. This system consists of seven distinct cognitive patterns, each optimized for different types of reasoning tasks, coordinated by a central orchestrator that can automatically select the most appropriate pattern or combine multiple patterns for complex queries.

## Core Architecture

### Cognitive Orchestrator (`src/cognitive/orchestrator.rs`)

The `CognitiveOrchestrator` serves as the central coordinator for all cognitive processing operations. It maintains a registry of all available cognitive patterns and provides three main reasoning strategies:

- **Automatic Strategy**: Uses adaptive pattern selection to determine the best approach
- **Specific Strategy**: Executes a single specified cognitive pattern
- **Ensemble Strategy**: Combines multiple patterns for comprehensive analysis

```rust
pub struct CognitiveOrchestrator {
    patterns: AHashMap<CognitivePatternType, Arc<dyn CognitivePattern>>,
    adaptive_selector: Arc<AdaptiveThinking>,
    performance_monitor: Arc<PerformanceMonitor>,
    brain_graph: Arc<BrainEnhancedKnowledgeGraph>,
    neural_server: Arc<NeuralProcessingServer>,
    config: CognitiveOrchestratorConfig,
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Pattern Registry**: Maintains all seven cognitive patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: Can execute multiple patterns simultaneously
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks execution metrics and success rates
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combines results from multiple patterns using weighted averaging
- **Adaptive Selection**: Automatically chooses optimal patterns based on query characteristics

#### Configuration Options:
- `enable_adaptive_selection`: Enables automatic pattern selection
- `enable_ensemble_methods`: Allows combining multiple patterns
- `default_timeout_ms`: Maximum execution time per pattern
- `max_parallel_patterns`: Maximum patterns to run simultaneously
- `performance_tracking`: Enables performance metrics collection

## Seven Cognitive Patterns
