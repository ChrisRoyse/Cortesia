```

**Deductive Reasoning Characteristics:**
- **Logic Flow**: General principles to specific conclusions
- **Certainty**: High confidence when premises are true
- **Structure**: If-then logical progressions
- **Validation**: Logical necessity verification

**Example Process:**
1. **Premise**: "Einstein developed special relativity"
2. **General Rule**: "Developers of major theories are influential scientists"
3. **Conclusion**: "Einstein is an influential scientist"

#### 2. Inductive Reasoning
