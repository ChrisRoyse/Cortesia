### Branch Status Analysis

#### Active vs Inactive Branches
```rust
"is_active": branch.is_active
```

**Branch States:**
- **Active (true)**: Branch is available for read/write operations
- **Inactive (false)**: Branch exists but is not currently accessible

**State Implications:**
- **Active branches** can be used for all operations (read, write, compare, merge)
- **Inactive branches** may be temporarily unavailable or archived
- **State changes** are managed by the branch manager and system administrators

#### Creation Timestamp Analysis
```rust
"created_at": branch.created_at.to_rfc3339(),
```

**Timestamp Features:**
- **ISO 8601 Format**: Standard format for cross-system compatibility
- **UTC Timezone**: Normalized to UTC for consistency
- **Precision**: Includes seconds for precise creation tracking
- **Sorting**: Enables chronological analysis of branch creation

### Branch Relationship Mapping

#### Parent-Child Relationships
```rust
"created_from": branch.created_from.as_str(),
```

**Relationship Types:**
- **Root Branches**: Created from "initial" or system default
- **Feature Branches**: Created from "main" or other production branches
- **Sub-branches**: Created from existing feature branches
- **Merge Branches**: Temporary branches created during merge operations

**Relationship Benefits:**
- **Lineage Tracking**: Understand the evolution of branches
- **Merge Planning**: Identify appropriate merge targets
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand branch interdependencies
- **Rollback Strategy**: Plan rollback paths through branch hierarchy
