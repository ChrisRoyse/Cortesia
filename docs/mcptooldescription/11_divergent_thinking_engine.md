### Key Variables and Functions

#### Primary Handler Function
```rust
pub async fn handle_divergent_thinking_engine(
    knowledge_engine: &Arc<RwLock<KnowledgeEngine>>,
    usage_stats: &Arc<RwLock<UsageStats>>,
    params: Value,
) -> std::result::Result<(Value, String, Vec<String>), String>
```

#### Input Processing Variables
```rust
let seed_concept = params.get("seed_concept")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_str())
    .ok_or("Missing required 'seed_concept' parameter")?;

let exploration_depth = params.get("exploration_depth")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_u64())
    .unwrap_or(3) as usize;

let creativity_level = params.get("creativity_level")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_f64())
    .unwrap_or(0.7) as f32;

let max_branches = params.get("max_branches")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_u64())
    .unwrap_or(10) as usize;
```

### Divergent Graph Traversal System

#### Core Exploration Function
```rust
use crate::mcp::llm_friendly_server::divergent_graph_traversal::explore_divergent_paths;

let exploration_result = explore_divergent_paths(
    knowledge_engine,
    seed_concept,
    exploration_depth,
    creativity_level,
    max_branches
).await;
```

This integrates with the sophisticated divergent graph traversal implementation located in `src/mcp/llm_friendly_server/divergent_graph_traversal.rs`.

#### Exploration Parameters

**1. Exploration Depth (1-5 layers)**
- **Layer 1**: Direct connections from seed concept
- **Layer 2**: Second-degree connections and relationships
- **Layer 3**: Third-degree exploration (default)
- **Layer 4**: Deep conceptual exploration
- **Layer 5**: Maximum depth creative discovery

**2. Creativity Level (0.0-1.0)**
- **0.0-0.3**: Conservative exploration (high relevance)
- **0.4-0.6**: Balanced creative-relevance approach
- **0.7-0.8**: Creative exploration (default range)
- **0.9-1.0**: Highly creative, potentially unexpected connections

**3. Max Branches (3-20)**
- Controls the breadth of exploration at each level
- Higher values = more comprehensive exploration
- Lower values = focused, targeted discovery

### Exploration Result Structure

#### Divergent Exploration Result
The exploration returns a comprehensive result structure containing:

```rust
// Inferred from the output structure
struct DivergentExplorationResult {
    paths: Vec<serde_json::Value>,
    discovered_entities: Vec<String>,
    discovered_relationships: Vec<String>,
    cross_domain_connections: Vec<serde_json::Value>,
    exploration_stats: ExplorationStats,
}

struct ExplorationStats {
    average_path_length: f32,
    max_depth_reached: usize,
    // Additional statistics
}
```

#### Path Discovery
**Creative Paths**: Novel connection sequences discovered during exploration
- Unexpected entity-to-entity connections
- Multi-hop relationship chains
- Cross-domain conceptual bridges
- Alternative perspective pathways

#### Entity Discovery
**New Entities**: Previously unknown or unexplored entities found during traversal
- Entities at the periphery of the seed concept

### Advanced Exploration Features

#### Creative Path Scoring
Each discovered path receives multiple scores:

**1. Creativity Score (0.0-1.0)**
- Measures how unexpected or novel the path is
- Based on rarity of connection patterns
- Influenced by cross-domain spans

**2. Novelty Score (0.0-1.0)**
- Assesses uniqueness of discovered relationships
- Compares against existing knowledge patterns
- Rewards uncommon association types

**3. Relevance Score (0.0-1.0)**
- Maintains connection to the seed concept
- Balances creativity with meaningful associations
- Prevents completely random explorations

#### Exploration Statistics

**Path Statistics:**
- Total paths discovered
- Average path length
- Length distribution
- Depth penetration analysis

**Discovery Statistics:**
- New entity count
- Relationship type diversity
- Domain coverage analysis
- Cross-domain bridge identification

**Quality Metrics:**

### Error Handling

#### Input Validation
```rust
if seed_concept.is_empty() {
    return Err("Seed concept cannot be empty".to_string());
}

// Parameter range validation
if exploration_depth < 1 || exploration_depth > 5 {
    return Err("Exploration depth must be between 1 and 5".to_string());
}

if creativity_level < 0.0 || creativity_level > 1.0 {
    return Err("Creativity level must be between 0.0 and 1.0".to_string());
}
```

#### Exploration Failures
The system handles cases where:
- Seed concept is not found in the knowledge graph
- Exploration reaches dead ends
- Creative paths become too disconnected
- Maximum exploration limits are reached
