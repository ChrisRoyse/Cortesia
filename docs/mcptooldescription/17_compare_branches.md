### Comparison Result Structure

#### Comparison Data Processing
```rust
// Inferred from usage patterns
struct BranchComparison {
    branch1: String,
    branch2: String,
    stats1: BranchStatistics,
    stats2: BranchStatistics,
    differences: DifferenceAnalysis,
}

struct BranchStatistics {
    total_triples: usize,
    total_nodes: usize,
    // Additional statistical measures
}

struct DifferenceAnalysis {
    only_in_first: usize,
    only_in_second: usize,
    common: usize,
    sample_differences: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### Statistical Analysis

}
```

**Statistical Metrics Include:**
- **total_triples**: Number of Subject-Predicate-Object relationships
- **total_nodes**: Number of unique entities in the knowledge graph
- **Additional Metrics**: Edge density, connectivity patterns, cluster information

    "common": comparison.differences.common,
    "sample_differences": comparison.differences.sample_differences
}
```

**Difference Categories:**
- **only_in_branch1**: Content unique to the first branch
- **only_in_branch2**: Content unique to the second branch  
- **common**: Content shared between both branches
- **sample_differences**: Representative examples of specific differences

### Comparison Algorithms

#### Structural Comparison
The system analyzes:
- **Graph Topology**: Overall structure and connectivity patterns
- **Entity Counts**: Number of unique entities in each branch

### Advanced Comparison Features

#### Change Impact Analysis
The comparison provides insights into:
- **Addition Impact**: How new content affects the knowledge graph
- **Deletion Impact**: What information would be lost in a merge
- **Modification Impact**: How changes affect existing relationships
- **Consistency Impact**: Whether changes maintain logical consistency

#### Merge Complexity Assessment
```rust
"sample_differences": comparison.differences.sample_differences
```

The sample differences help assess:
- **Conflict Potential**: Whether branches have contradictory information
- **Integration Difficulty**: How complex merging would be
- **Quality Assessment**: Whether changes represent improvements
- **Validation Needs**: What verification might be required

### Error Handling

#### Parameter Validation
```rust
let branch1 = params.get("branch1")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_str())
    .ok_or("Missing required field: branch1")?;

let branch2 = params.get("branch2")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_str())
    .ok_or("Missing required field: branch2")?;
```

#### Branch Manager Errors
```rust
let branch_manager_arc = get_branch_manager().await
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to get branch manager: {}", e))?;

let branch_manager_guard = branch_manager_arc.read().await;
let branch_manager = branch_manager_guard.as_ref()
    .ok_or("Branch manager not initialized")?;
```

#### Comparison Execution Errors
```rust
let comparison = branch_manager.compare_branches(branch1, branch2).await
    .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to compare branches: {}", e))?;
```

**Error Scenarios:**

### Best Practices for Developers

1. **Pre-Merge Analysis**: Always compare branches before merging
2. **Sample Review**: Examine sample differences to understand changes
3. **Impact Assessment**: Consider the implications of unique content
4. **Conflict Detection**: Look for potentially contradictory information
5. **Size Considerations**: Be aware of performance implications for large branches

### Usage Examples

#### Pre-Merge Assessment
```json
{
  "branch1": "main",
  "branch2": "feature-temporal-reasoning"
}
```
**Use Case**: Assess differences before merging feature branch back to main

#### Development Progress
```json
{
  "branch1": "baseline-experiment",
  "branch2": "enhanced-experiment"
}
```
**Use Case**: Compare experimental branches to measure improvement

#### Quality Assurance
```json
{
  "branch1": "production-backup",
  "branch2": "main"
}
```
**Use Case**: Verify production changes against known-good backup

#### Research Analysis
```json
{
  "branch1": "physics-v1",
  "branch2": "physics-v2"
}
```
**Use Case**: Compare different versions of domain-specific knowledge

### Suggestions System
```rust
let suggestions = vec![
    "Review differences before merging".to_string(),
    "Use sample_differences to inspect changes".to_string(),
    "Consider merge strategy based on differences".to_string(),
];
```

### Advanced Analysis Capabilities

#### Change Pattern Recognition
The comparison can identify:
- **Content Expansion**: Systematic addition of related information
- **Refinement Patterns**: Improvements to existing knowledge
- **Domain Evolution**: Changes within specific knowledge domains

#### Merge Strategy Recommendations
Based on comparison results:
- **Accept Source**: When target has extensive unique improvements
- **Accept Target**: When source changes conflict with target improvements
- **Manual Merge**: When both branches have significant unique content
- **Selective Merge**: When only specific changes should be integrated
