# Phase 11: Production Features - Micro-Phase Breakdown

## Overview

Phase 11 focuses on production-ready features essential for deploying and operating the neuromorphic knowledge graph system in production environments. This phase is broken down into 6 major components, each with detailed micro-tasks designed for rapid AI implementation.

## Component Structure

### 1. Monitoring Infrastructure (Tasks 11.1.x)
Real-time observability and metrics collection for production systems.

### 2. Deployment Automation (Tasks 11.2.x)
Automated deployment pipelines and container orchestration.

### 3. Health Checks (Tasks 11.3.x)
System health monitoring and automatic recovery mechanisms.

### 4. Load Testing Framework (Tasks 11.4.x)
Performance validation under production-scale workloads.

### 5. Production Benchmarking (Tasks 11.5.x)
Continuous performance monitoring and optimization.

### 6. Security Hardening (Tasks 11.S.x)
Comprehensive security controls, compliance monitoring, and incident response automation.

## Success Criteria

Each micro-task must:
- Be completable in under 2 hours by an AI agent
- Have clear input/output specifications
- Include validation tests
- Integrate with existing Phase 1-10 components
- Meet production-grade quality standards

## Dependencies

- Completed Phase 1-10 implementations
- Rust ecosystem with production crates
- Container runtime (Docker/Podman)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana compatible)

## Execution Order

Tasks should be executed in numerical order within each component. Components can be developed in parallel after their prerequisites are met.
