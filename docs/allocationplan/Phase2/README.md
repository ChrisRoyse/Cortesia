# Phase 2: Neuromorphic Allocation Engine

## Overview
Phase 2 implements the core neuromorphic allocation engine that processes validated facts through spiking neural networks with Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding. This phase establishes the foundation for intelligent memory allocation using biological neural principles.

## Goals
- Integrate Phase 0A quality validation
- Implement TTFS spike encoding with <1ms timing
- Create multi-column parallel processing with 4x SIMD speedup
- Build hierarchy detection and property inheritance
- Establish allocation scoring and decision system
- Achieve <8ms end-to-end processing

## Structure
This phase contains 63 micro-tasks organized into 10 sections:

1. **Quality Integration (01-10)**: Phase 0A integration
2. **TTFS Encoding (11-23)**: Spike encoding implementation
3. **Neural Architecture (24-28)**: ruv-FANN integration
4. **Parallel Processing (29-33)**: Multi-column processing
5. **Hierarchy Detection (34-38)**: Concept hierarchies
6. **Scoring System (39-43)**: Allocation scoring
7. **Document Processing (44-48)**: Document pipeline
8. **Allocation Pipeline (49-53)**: Core allocation
9. **System Integration (54-58)**: Full integration
10. **Optimization (59-63)**: Performance tuning

## Execution
Each micro-task is designed to be completed in 15-20 minutes by an AI agent. Tasks should be executed in order, respecting dependencies defined in `00_EXECUTION_ORDER.md`.

## Performance Targets
- TTFS encoding: < 1ms per concept
- Multi-column processing: < 5ms
- Lateral inhibition: < 3ms
- Full pipeline: < 8ms (p99)
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- Throughput: > 50 concepts/second

## Dependencies
- Phase 0: Foundation structures
- Phase 1: Cortical columns
- ruv-FANN: Neural network library
