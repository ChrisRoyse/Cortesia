# Phase 4: Inheritance-Based Knowledge Compression - Micro Phase Breakdown

**Duration**: 1 week (5 days)
**Goal**: Achieve 10x compression through hierarchical inheritance with exceptions
**Team Size**: 2-3 developers executing micro tasks

## Execution Order

This phase is broken down into 6 major tasks, each with multiple micro phases:

1. **Task 4.1**: Hierarchical Node System (Day 1) - 8 micro phases
2. **Task 4.2**: Exception Handling System (Day 2) - 7 micro phases  
3. **Task 4.3**: Property Compression Engine (Day 3) - 6 micro phases
4. **Task 4.4**: Dynamic Hierarchy Optimization (Day 4) - 8 micro phases
5. **Task 4.5**: Compression Metrics and Analysis (Day 5 AM) - 5 micro phases
6. **Task 4.6**: Integration and Benchmarks (Day 5 PM) - 4 micro phases

## Success Criteria Summary

### Must Achieve
- [ ] Storage reduction: > 10x vs flat storage
- [ ] Property lookup: < 1ms including inheritance chain
- [ ] Exception storage: < 5% of total properties
- [ ] Property inheritance: 100% correct
- [ ] Exception override: 100% accurate
- [ ] No property loss during compression

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Property resolution: < 100μs per lookup
- [ ] Batch inheritance update: < 10ms for 1000 nodes
- [ ] Exception checking: O(1) time complexity

## AI Agent Execution Notes

Each micro phase file contains:
- **Clear objective** (1-2 sentences)
- **Specific deliverable** (exact file/code to create)
- **Success criteria** (testable conditions)
- **Estimated time** (15-60 minutes)
- **Dependencies** (which micro phases must complete first)

All micro phases are designed to be:
- ✅ **Atomic**: Single, focused task
- ✅ **Testable**: Clear pass/fail criteria  
- ✅ **Time-bounded**: 15-60 minute execution
- ✅ **Independent**: Minimal dependencies between phases
- ✅ **AI-friendly**: Clear instructions for automated execution
