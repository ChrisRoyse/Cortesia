# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 3.3 - Compression Orchestrator

You are tasked with implementing the compression orchestrator that coordinates the entire compression process. Your goal is to create `src/compression/orchestrator.rs` with intelligent compression workflow management.

## Your Task
Implement the `CompressionOrchestrator` struct that coordinates analysis, promotion, and validation phases of property compression with intelligent scheduling and progress tracking.

## Specific Requirements
1. Create `src/compression/orchestrator.rs` with CompressionOrchestrator struct
2. Coordinate analysis and promotion phases intelligently
3. Implement progress tracking and reporting
4. Add compression scheduling and batching
5. Handle errors and provide recovery mechanisms
6. Optimize compression order for maximum effectiveness

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use crate::compression::analyzer::{PropertyAnalyzer, PropertyAnalysis};
use crate::compression::promoter::{PropertyPromoter, PromotionResult};
use crate::hierarchy::tree::InheritanceHierarchy;

pub struct CompressionOrchestrator {
    analyzer: PropertyAnalyzer,
    promoter: PropertyPromoter,
    scheduler: CompressionScheduler,
    progress_tracker: ProgressTracker,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct CompressionReport {
    pub total_properties_analyzed: usize,
    pub promotions_attempted: usize,
    pub promotions_successful: usize,
    pub bytes_saved: usize,
    pub compression_ratio: f32,
    pub duration: std::time::Duration,
}

impl CompressionOrchestrator {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    
    pub fn compress_hierarchy(&mut self, hierarchy: &mut InheritanceHierarchy) -> CompressionReport;
    
    pub fn compress_incrementally(&mut self, hierarchy: &mut InheritanceHierarchy, max_promotions: usize) -> CompressionReport;
    
    pub fn get_compression_strategy(&self, hierarchy: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> CompressionStrategy;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Coordinates compression phases effectively
- [ ] Provides comprehensive progress tracking
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully with recovery
- [ ] Optimizes compression order for maximum benefit

## File to Create
