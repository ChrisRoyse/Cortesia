# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 4.2 - Tree Balancer

You are tasked with implementing the tree balancer that optimizes hierarchy depth and branching. Create `src/optimization/balancer.rs` with smart tree balancing algorithms.

## Your Task
Implement the `TreeBalancer` struct that balances inheritance trees to minimize depth while preserving semantic relationships.

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use crate::hierarchy::tree::InheritanceHierarchy;
use crate::hierarchy::node::NodeId;

pub struct TreeBalancer {
    max_depth_threshold: u32,
    branching_factor_target: u32,
    balancing_strategy: BalancingStrategy,
}

impl TreeBalancer {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn balance_tree(&self, hierarchy: &mut InheritanceHierarchy) -> BalancingReport;
    pub fn analyze_balance(&self, hierarchy: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> BalanceAnalysis;
    pub fn calculate_optimal_structure(&self, hierarchy: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> OptimalStructure;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduces maximum hierarchy depth
- [ ] Balances branching factors across the tree
- [ ] Improves property resolution performance
- [ ] Maintains inheritance semantics
