# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 4.5 - Optimization Metrics

You are tasked with implementing comprehensive metrics for optimization effectiveness. Create `src/optimization/metrics.rs` with detailed performance tracking.

## Your Task
Implement the `OptimizationMetrics` struct that tracks and analyzes optimization effectiveness across all optimization strategies.

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub struct OptimizationMetrics {
    baseline_metrics: BaselineMetrics,
    current_metrics: CurrentMetrics,
    optimization_history: Vec<OptimizationEvent>,
}

impl OptimizationMetrics {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn record_optimization(&mut self, optimization_type: OptimizationType, report: OptimizationReport);
    pub fn calculate_improvement_ratio(&self) -> f32;
    pub fn get_performance_trends(&self) -> PerformanceTrends;
    pub fn generate_metrics_report(&self) -> MetricsReport;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Accurately tracks optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Provides detailed performance analytics
- [ ] Identifies optimization trends and patterns
- [ ] Enables data-driven optimization decisions
