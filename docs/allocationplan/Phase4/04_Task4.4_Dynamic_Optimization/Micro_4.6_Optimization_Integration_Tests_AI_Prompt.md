# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 4.6 - Optimization Integration Tests

You are tasked with creating comprehensive integration tests for the optimization system. Create `tests/integration/task_4_4_optimization.rs` with end-to-end optimization tests.

## Your Task
Implement integration tests that verify the complete Task 4.4 optimization system works correctly and improves hierarchy performance.

## Expected Test Functions
```rust
#[test]
fn test_full_optimization_workflow() {
    // Test complete optimization workflow
}

#[test]
fn test_hierarchy_reorganization_effectiveness() {
    // Test reorganizer improves performance
}

#[test]
fn test_tree_balancing_optimization() {
    // Test balancer reduces depth and improves structure
}

#[test]
fn test_dead_branch_pruning() {
    // Test pruner removes unused elements safely
}

#[test]
fn test_incremental_optimization_performance() {
    // Test incremental optimization doesn't block operations
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All optimization components work together effectively
- [ ] Optimization improves hierarchy performance measurably
- [ ] No data loss or corruption during optimization
- [ ] Incremental optimization works without blocking
