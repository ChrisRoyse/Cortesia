# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 4.3 - Dead Branch Pruner

You are tasked with implementing the dead branch pruner that removes unused nodes and properties. Create `src/optimization/pruner.rs` with intelligent pruning algorithms.

## Your Task
Implement the `DeadBranchPruner` struct that identifies and safely removes unused nodes, properties, and relationships from the hierarchy.

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use crate::hierarchy::tree::InheritanceHierarchy;
use crate::hierarchy::node::NodeId;

pub struct DeadBranchPruner {
    usage_tracking: UsageTracker,
    pruning_threshold: std::time::Duration,
    safety_checks: SafetyChecks,
}

impl DeadBranchPruner {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn prune_dead_branches(&self, hierarchy: &mut InheritanceHierarchy) -> PruningReport;
    pub fn identify_dead_nodes(&self, hierarchy: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> Vec<NodeId>;
    pub fn identify_unused_properties(&self, hierarchy: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> Vec<(NodeId, String)>;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Safely identifies and removes unused nodes
- [ ] Removes orphaned properties and relationships
- [ ] Reduces memory usage significantly
- [ ] Maintains hierarchy integrity
