# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 4.8 - Dynamic Optimization Validation

You are tasked with implementing validation for optimization correctness. Create `src/optimization/validator.rs` with comprehensive optimization validation.

## Your Task
Implement the `OptimizationValidator` struct that validates optimization results maintain correctness while improving performance.

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use crate::hierarchy::tree::InheritanceHierarchy;
use crate::optimization::metrics::OptimizationMetrics;

pub struct OptimizationValidator {
    validation_depth: ValidationDepth,
    correctness_checks: CorrectnessChecks,
}

impl OptimizationValidator {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn validate_optimization(&self, before: &HierarchySnapshot, after: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> ValidationReport;
    pub fn verify_semantic_preservation(&self, before: &HierarchySnapshot, after: &InheritanceHierarchy) -> bool;
    pub fn measure_performance_improvement(&self, before_metrics: &OptimizationMetrics, after_metrics: &OptimizationMetrics) -> PerformanceImprovement;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Validates optimization preserves all semantic relationships
- [ ] Verifies property resolution still works correctly
- [ ] Measures actual performance improvements
- [ ] Detects any optimization-induced errors
