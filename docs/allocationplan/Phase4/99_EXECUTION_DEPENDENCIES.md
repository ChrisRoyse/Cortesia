## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Can Run in Parallel:
- **Within Task 4.1**: Micro phases 1.1 and 1.2 can start simultaneously
- **Within Task 4.2**: Micro phases 2.4 and 2.5 can run in parallel after 2.3
- **Within Task 4.4**: Micro phases 4.2 and 4.3 can run in parallel after 4.1
- **Cross-team work**: While one team works on Task N, another can prepare for Task N+1

### Sequential Dependencies:
- **Task-level**: Each task must complete before the next begins
- **Core infrastructure**: 1.1-1.3 must be sequential (foundational)
- **Integration points**: All .7/.8 micro phases (tests/benchmarks) must be last in their task

## Critical Path Analysis

**Total estimated time**: 17.5 hours across 5 days (3.5 hours/day average)

### Longest path through dependencies:
1. Task 4.1: 280 minutes (4h 40m)
2. Task 4.2: 225 minutes (3h 45m) 
3. Task 4.3: 225 minutes (3h 45m)
4. Task 4.4: 260 minutes (4h 20m)
5. Task 4.5: 150 minutes (2h 30m)
6. Task 4.6: 150 minutes (2h 30m)

**Total**: 1290 minutes = 21.5 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies:
1. **1.4 Property Resolution Engine** - Core algorithm, affects everything downstream
2. **2.2 Exception Detection Engine** - Complex AI logic, may need iteration
3. **3.2 Property Promotion Engine** - Semantic correctness critical
4. **4.1 Hierarchy Reorganizer** - Complex graph algorithms

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Extra time buffer**: Add 50% to high-risk phases
- **Early prototyping**: Start 1.4, 2.2, 3.2, 4.1 with simple implementations
- **Fallback plans**: Simpler algorithms if complex ones fail
- **Parallel development**: Work on tests while implementing core logic

## AI Agent Instructions

For each micro phase:
1. **Read the micro phase file completely**
2. **Verify all dependencies are complete**
3. **Implement exactly what's specified in deliverables**
4. **Run all required tests until they pass**
5. **Measure performance against success criteria**
6. **Update any affected documentation**
7. **Mark phase complete only when all criteria met**

**Do not proceed to next micro phase until current one fully meets success criteria.**
