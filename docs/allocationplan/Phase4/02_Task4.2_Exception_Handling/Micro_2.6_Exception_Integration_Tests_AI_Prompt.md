# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 2.6 - Exception Integration Tests

You are tasked with creating comprehensive integration tests for the complete exception handling system. Your goal is to create `tests/integration/task_4_2_exception_handling.rs` with end-to-end tests.

## Your Task
Implement comprehensive integration tests that verify the full Task 4.2 exception handling system including detection, storage, application, learning, and optimization.

## Specific Requirements
1. Create `tests/integration/task_4_2_exception_handling.rs` with full system tests
2. Test end-to-end exception workflows
3. Verify integration with hierarchy and property systems
4. Test performance under various exception scenarios
5. Verify memory efficiency and optimization
6. Test concurrent access and thread safety

## Expected Test Functions
```rust
#[test]
fn test_full_exception_workflow() {
    // Test complete workflow: detection -> storage -> application
}

#[test]
fn test_exception_detection_accuracy() {
    // Test detection engine accuracy with various scenarios
}

#[test]
fn test_exception_application_integration() {
    // Test integration with property resolver
}

#[test]
fn test_pattern_learning_effectiveness() {
    // Test learning system improves over time
}

#[test]
fn test_storage_optimization_benefits() {
    // Test optimization reduces memory usage
}

#[test]
fn test_concurrent_exception_handling() {
    // Test thread safety under concurrent access
}

#[test]
fn test_exception_performance_impact() {
    // Test performance impact of exception system
}

#[test]
fn test_real_world_animal_exceptions() {
    // Test with realistic animal taxonomy exceptions
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All exception components work together seamlessly
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal for non-exception cases
- [ ] Memory usage stays within bounds
- [ ] Thread safety is maintained under concurrent access
- [ ] Detection accuracy meets requirements
- [ ] Learning system shows improvement over time
