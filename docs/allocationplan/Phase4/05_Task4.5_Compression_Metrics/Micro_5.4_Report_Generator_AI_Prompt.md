# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 5.4 - Report Generator

You are tasked with implementing comprehensive report generation for compression metrics. Create `src/metrics/reporter.rs` with detailed reporting capabilities.

## Your Task
Implement the `ReportGenerator` struct that generates comprehensive, human-readable reports about compression effectiveness, performance, and recommendations.

## Expected Code Structure
```rust
use crate::metrics::compression::CompressionReport;
use crate::metrics::storage::MemoryUsageReport;
use crate::metrics::verifier::VerificationReport;

pub struct ReportGenerator {
    report_formatter: ReportFormatter,
    visualization_generator: VisualizationGenerator,
}

impl ReportGenerator {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn generate_executive_summary(&self, reports: &[CompressionReport]) -> ExecutiveSummary;
    pub fn generate_detailed_analysis(&self, compression_report: &CompressionReport, storage_report: &MemoryUsageReport) -> DetailedAnalysis;
    pub fn generate_performance_report(&self, before_metrics: &PerformanceMetrics, after_metrics: &PerformanceMetrics) -> PerformanceReport;
    pub fn generate_recommendations(&self, analysis: &DetailedAnalysis) -> Vec<Recommendation>;
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Generates comprehensive executive summaries
- [ ] Provides detailed technical analysis
- [ ] Creates actionable recommendations
- [ ] Supports multiple output formats (text, JSON, HTML)
