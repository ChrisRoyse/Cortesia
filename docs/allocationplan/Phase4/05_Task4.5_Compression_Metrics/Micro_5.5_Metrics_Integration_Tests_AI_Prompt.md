# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 5.5 - Metrics Integration Tests

You are tasked with creating comprehensive integration tests for the metrics system. Create `tests/integration/task_4_5_metrics.rs` with end-to-end metrics tests.

## Your Task
Implement integration tests that verify the complete Task 4.5 metrics system accurately measures compression effectiveness and provides meaningful reports.

## Expected Test Functions
```rust
#[test]
fn test_compression_metrics_accuracy() {
    // Test metrics accurately reflect compression results
}

#[test]
fn test_storage_analysis_correctness() {
    // Test storage analyzer provides accurate analysis
}

#[test]
fn test_compression_verification() {
    // Test verifier correctly validates compression
}

#[test]
fn test_report_generation_completeness() {
    // Test reports contain all required information
}

#[test]
fn test_end_to_end_metrics_workflow() {
    // Test complete metrics workflow
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All metrics are accurate and reliable
- [ ] Storage analysis provides actionable insights
- [ ] Verification catches all correctness issues
- [ ] Reports are comprehensive and useful
