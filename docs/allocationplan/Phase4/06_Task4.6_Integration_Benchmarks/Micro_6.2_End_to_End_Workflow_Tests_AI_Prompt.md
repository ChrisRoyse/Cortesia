# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 6.2 - End-to-End Workflow Tests

You are tasked with creating end-to-end workflow tests for complete Phase 4 scenarios. Create `tests/integration/phase_4_workflows.rs` with comprehensive workflow testing.

## Your Task
Implement end-to-end workflow tests that verify complete user scenarios from hierarchy creation through optimization and measurement.

## Expected Test Functions
```rust
#[test]
fn test_knowledge_base_creation_workflow() {
    // Test creating and optimizing a knowledge base from scratch
}

#[test]
fn test_incremental_hierarchy_updates() {
    // Test adding nodes and properties to existing hierarchy
}

#[test]
fn test_exception_detection_and_handling_workflow() {
    // Test automatic exception detection and management
}

#[test]
fn test_compression_and_optimization_workflow() {
    // Test property compression followed by optimization
}

#[test]
fn test_concurrent_access_workflow() {
    // Test multiple concurrent operations on hierarchy
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All workflows complete successfully
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable throughout workflows
- [ ] Concurrent access works without corruption
- [ ] System state remains consistent
