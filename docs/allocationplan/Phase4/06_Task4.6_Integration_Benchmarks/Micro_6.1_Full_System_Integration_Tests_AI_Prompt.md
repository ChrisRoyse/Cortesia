# AI Prompt: Micro Phase 6.1 - Full System Integration Tests

You are tasked with creating comprehensive integration tests for the complete Phase 4 inheritance system. Create `tests/integration/phase_4_full_system.rs` with end-to-end system tests.

## Your Task
Implement comprehensive integration tests that verify all Phase 4 components (hierarchical nodes, exceptions, compression, optimization, metrics) work together seamlessly.

## Expected Test Functions
```rust
#[test]
fn test_complete_inheritance_workflow() {
    // Test full workflow: create hierarchy -> detect exceptions -> compress -> optimize -> measure
}

#[test]
fn test_cross_component_integration() {
    // Test integration between all major components
}

#[test]
fn test_real_world_animal_taxonomy_scenario() {
    // Test with realistic animal taxonomy data
}

#[test]
fn test_software_class_hierarchy_scenario() {
    // Test with software class hierarchy
}

#[test]
fn test_system_performance_under_load() {
    // Test performance with large hierarchies
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All components integrate seamlessly
- [ ] Real-world scenarios work correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements under load
- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout workflows
