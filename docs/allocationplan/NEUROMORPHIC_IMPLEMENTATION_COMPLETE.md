## 🔄 INTEGRATION WITH RUV-FANN ECOSYSTEM

### Architecture Selection Matrix ✅

| Pattern Type | Optimal ruv-FANN Architecture | Use Case |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Semantic | Multi-Layer Perceptron (#1) | Concept similarity and relationships |
| Structural | Graph Neural Network (#15) | Topology analysis and hierarchy |
| Temporal | Temporal Convolutional Network (#20) | Sequence detection and patterns |
| Exception | Sparsely Connected Network (#28) | Inhibitory patterns and contradictions |
| Dynamic Growth | Cascade Correlation Network (#29) | Network adaptation and expansion |
| Memory Tasks | LSTM/GRU (#6, #7) | Sequential memory and context |

### Ephemeral Intelligence Implementation ✅

The system creates specialized neural networks on-demand for specific pattern types:

```rust
let optimal_architecture = self.network_selector.select_optimal_architecture(input_pattern);
let ephemeral_network = ruv_fann::create_ephemeral_network(optimal_architecture.architecture_id)?;
```

This enables the system to dynamically adapt to new types of knowledge patterns without retraining the entire system.
