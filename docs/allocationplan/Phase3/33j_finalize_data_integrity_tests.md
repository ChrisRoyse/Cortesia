# Task 33j: Finalize Data Integrity Tests

**Estimated Time**: 2 minutes  
**Dependencies**: 33i  
**Stage**: Data Integrity Validation  

## Objective
Run final validation and mark data integrity testing complete.

## Implementation Steps

1. Execute final validation:
```bash
# Run all integrity tests
./scripts/run_integrity_tests.sh

# Generate comprehensive report
cargo test --test comprehensive_validator --release
```

2. Update validation checklist:
```markdown
# Data Integrity Tests - COMPLETE ✅

## Referential Integrity ✅
- [x] Concept references validated
- [x] Inheritance relationships consistent
- [x] Broken references detected
- [x] Orphaned concepts identified

## Data Consistency ✅
- [x] Property inheritance validated
- [x] Cache synchronization verified
- [x] Temporal versioning consistent
- [x] Concurrent operation consistency

## Cross-Phase Synchronization ✅
- [x] Phase 2 memory pool synchronized
- [x] TTFS encoding consistent
- [x] Cortical column mappings accurate
- [x] Allocation metadata synchronized

## Error Recovery ✅
- [x] Corruption detection working
- [x] Transaction rollback tested
- [x] Orphan cleanup validated
- [x] Recovery mechanisms verified
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All integrity tests pass
- [ ] Data consistency maintained
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms working

## Success Metrics
- 100% test success rate
- No data inconsistencies detected
- All recovery mechanisms functional

## Next Task
