# Task 34i: Test Performance Degradation

**Estimated Time**: 4 minutes  
**Dependencies**: 34h  
**Stage**: Concurrency Testing  

## Objective
Measure performance degradation patterns with increasing concurrency.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add to `tests/concurrency/high_load_test.rs`:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_performance_degradation_patterns() {
    let brain_graph = setup_concurrency_test_graph().await;
    
    let concurrency_levels = vec![10, 50, 100, 200];
    let mut performance_data = Vec::new();
    
    for &concurrency in &concurrency_levels {
        println!("Testing concurrency level: {}", concurrency);
        
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        let success_counter = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));
        
        let tasks: Vec<_> = (0..concurrency)
            .map(|i| {
                let graph = brain_graph.clone();
                let counter = success_counter.clone();
                
                tokio::spawn(async move {
                    let concept_id = format!("perf_test_{}_{}", concurrency, i);
                    let req = create_test_allocation_request(&concept_id);
                    
                    if let Ok(_) = graph.allocate_memory(req).await {
                        counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
                    }
                })
            })
            .collect();
        
        futures::future::join_all(tasks).await;
        let elapsed = start_time.elapsed();
        
        let successes = success_counter.load(Ordering::SeqCst);
        let throughput = successes as f64 / elapsed.as_secs_f64();
        
        performance_data.push((concurrency, throughput, elapsed));
        
        println!("Concurrency {}: {:.2} ops/sec in {:?}", 
                concurrency, throughput, elapsed);
        
        // Brief pause between tests
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)).await;
    }
    
    // Analyze performance degradation
    for i in 1..performance_data.len() {
        let (prev_concurrency, prev_throughput, _) = performance_data[i-1];
        let (curr_concurrency, curr_throughput, _) = performance_data[i];
        
        let degradation_ratio = curr_throughput / prev_throughput;
        println!("Throughput ratio from {} to {}: {:.2}", 
                prev_concurrency, curr_concurrency, degradation_ratio);
        
        // Throughput shouldn't degrade too dramatically
        assert!(degradation_ratio > 0.3, 
               "Severe performance degradation detected");
    }
    
    // System should still perform reasonably at highest concurrency
    let (_, highest_throughput, _) = performance_data.last().unwrap();
    assert!(*highest_throughput > 5.0, 
           "System should maintain minimum throughput under high load");
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance degradation test added
- [ ] Test measures multiple concurrency levels
- [ ] Degradation patterns analyzed

## Success Metrics
- Performance doesn't degrade below 30% of baseline
- System maintains minimum throughput
- Clear degradation patterns identified
