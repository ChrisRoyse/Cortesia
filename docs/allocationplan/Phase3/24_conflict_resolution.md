**EXECUTE IN ORDER**: 24a → 24b → 24c → 24d → 24e → 24f → 24g → 24h → 24i → 24j → 24k → 24l → 24m → 24n → 24o → 24p → 24q → 24r → 24s

## Original Content Summary

**TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE!** ✅

This massive 706-line file has been successfully broken down into 19 focused micro-tasks. 

**Before**: One overwhelming "15-20 minute" task that was actually 3+ hours of work  
**After**: 19 clearly defined tasks, each taking 3-5 minutes

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation between detection and resolution logic
- Testable conflict scenarios at each step
- Manageable complexity per task
- Realistic time estimates

The original content included comprehensive conflict detection across property, temporal, semantic, and inheritance levels, plus intelligent resolution strategies with ML guidance and audit trails. This has been restructured into manageable, sequential tasks.
