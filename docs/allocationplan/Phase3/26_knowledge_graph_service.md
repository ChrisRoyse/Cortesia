## Original Content Summary

**TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE!** ✅

This massive 618-line file has been successfully broken down into 17 focused micro-tasks. 

**Before**: One overwhelming "15-20 minute" task that was actually 3+ hours of work  
**After**: 17 clearly defined tasks, each taking 3-5 minutes

**Benefits**:
- Clear service architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Testable service operations at each step
- Manageable transaction and caching logic
- Realistic time estimates

The original content included comprehensive knowledge graph service with transactions, caching, monitoring, service discovery, and error recovery. This has been restructured into manageable, sequential tasks.
