# Task 22: Branch Management System

**THIS TASK HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN INTO MICRO-TASKS**

**Original Size**: 624 lines (DISASTER!)  
**New Structure**: 16 micro-tasks (22a-22p)  
**Total Time**: 58 minutes (was falsely marked as 15-20 minutes)

## Micro-Task Breakdown

### Foundation Tasks
- **22a**: Create Branch Types Enum (3 min)
- **22b**: Create Basic Branch Struct (4 min)
- **22c**: Create Branch Manager (4 min)
- **22d**: Create Branch Metadata (3 min)

### Branch Operations Tasks
- **22e**: Implement Branch Creation (4 min)
- **22f**: Implement Branch Switching (4 min)
- **22g**: Implement Branch Deletion (4 min)
- **22h**: Implement Branch Listing (3 min)

### Merge and Conflict Tasks
- **22i**: Create Merge Strategy Enum (3 min)
- **22j**: Implement Basic Merge (5 min)
- **22k**: Implement Merge Conflict Detection (5 min)
- **22l**: Implement Merge Conflict Resolution (5 min)

### Versioning and History Tasks
- **22m**: Create Branch History Tracking (4 min)
- **22n**: Implement Branch Comparison (4 min)
- **22o**: Create Branch Tests (4 min)
- **22p**: Create Integration Test (3 min)

**EXECUTE IN ORDER**: 22a → 22b → 22c → 22d → 22e → 22f → 22g → 22h → 22i → 22j → 22k → 22l → 22m → 22n → 22o → 22p

## Original Content Summary

**TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE!** ✅

This massive 624-line file has been successfully broken down into 16 focused micro-tasks. 

**Before**: One overwhelming "15-20 minute" task that was actually 3+ hours of work  
**After**: 16 clearly defined tasks, each taking 3-5 minutes

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation between branch operations and merge logic
- Testable branch workflows at each step
- Manageable conflict resolution strategy
- Realistic time estimates

The original content included sophisticated branching with merge strategies, conflict detection, history tracking, and performance optimization. This has been restructured into manageable, sequential tasks.
