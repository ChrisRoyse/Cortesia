**THIS TASK HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN INTO MICRO-TASKS**

**Original Size**: 612 lines (DISASTER!)  
**New Structure**: 16 micro-tasks (17a-17p)  
**Total Time**: 58 minutes (was falsely marked as 15-20 minutes)

**EXECUTE IN ORDER**: 17a → 17b → 17c → 17d → 17e → 17f → 17g → 17h → 17i → 17j → 17k → 17l → 17m → 17n → 17o → 17p

## Original Content Summary

**TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE!** ✅

This massive 612-line file has been successfully broken down into 16 focused micro-tasks. 

**Before**: One overwhelming "15-20 minute" task that was actually 3+ hours of work  
**After**: 16 clearly defined tasks, each taking 3-5 minutes

**Benefits**:
- Clear progression from indexing to advanced search algorithms
- Testable search components at each step
- Performance optimization built incrementally
- Realistic time estimates

The original content included sophisticated semantic search with embeddings, similarity algorithms, ranking, query expansion, and performance optimization. This has been restructured into manageable, sequential tasks.
