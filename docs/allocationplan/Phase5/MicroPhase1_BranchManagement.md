# Micro Phase 1: Branch Management System

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 (Neuromorphic Allocation Engine), Phase 3 (Knowledge Graph Schema)  
**Goal**: Implement Git-like branching with copy-on-write and neural allocation guidance

## AI-Executable Task Breakdown

### Task 1.1: Branch Data Structures (2 hours)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Implement the core branch data structures in Rust for the temporal versioning system. Create:

1. `Branch` struct with fields: id, name, parent, created_at, consolidation_state, head_version, metadata
2. `BranchId` type with UUID generation
3. `ConsolidationState` enum: WorkingMemory, ShortTerm, Consolidating, LongTerm
4. `BranchMetadata` struct tracking: creation_time, last_modified, access_count, neural_pathway_id

Requirements:
- Use atomic operations for thread safety
- Implement serialization/deserialization
- Add validation for branch names (no special chars, max 50 chars)
- Include memory estimation methods

Expected Output: Complete Rust module at src/temporal/branch/types.rs
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All structs compile without warnings
- [ ] UUID generation works correctly
- [ ] Atomic operations for concurrent access
- [ ] Serialization tests pass
- [ ] Memory estimation within 5% accuracy

### Task 1.2: Copy-on-Write Graph Storage (3 hours)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Implement copy-on-write (COW) graph storage for efficient branching. Create:

1. `CopyOnWriteGraph` struct managing base snapshots and local changes
2. Page-based storage system (4KB pages) for memory efficiency
3. `PageId` calculation from `NodeId` using modulo operation
4. Change tracking with `ChangeLog` for delta generation
5. Memory usage calculation methods

Technical Requirements:
- PAGE_SIZE = 4096 bytes
- Use DashMap for thread-safe page storage
- Implement lazy loading from base snapshots
- Track dirty pages for write operations
- Support batch operations for performance

Expected Output: Complete implementation at src/temporal/branch/cow.rs with unit tests
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] COW semantics work correctly (reads from base, writes to local)
- [ ] Memory usage starts at 0 for new branches
- [ ] Page-based storage reduces memory overhead
- [ ] Concurrent read/write operations are safe
- [ ] Performance: <10ms branch creation for 1M node graph

### Task 1.3: Branch Manager Implementation (4 hours)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Implement the BranchManager that orchestrates branch operations. Create:

1. `BranchManager` struct with DashMap storage and version store integration
2. `create_branch()` method with parent linking and neural pathway recording
3. `switch_branch()` method with <1ms performance target
4. `delete_branch()` method with cleanup and validation
5. Integration with Phase 2 allocation engine for branch placement decisions

Neural Integration Requirements:
- Record neural pathways used in branch creation decisions
- Use cortical column consensus for branch naming suggestions
- Store TTFS timings for branch access patterns
- Apply lateral inhibition for branch conflict resolution

Expected Output: src/temporal/branch/manager.rs with comprehensive error handling
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Branch creation completes in <10ms
- [ ] Branch switching in <1ms (zero-copy validation)
- [ ] Neural pathway integration works with Phase 2 system
- [ ] Proper cleanup on branch deletion
- [ ] Thread-safe concurrent operations

### Task 1.4: Consolidation State Machine (2 hours)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Implement automatic consolidation state transitions based on biological memory timings. Create:

1. `ConsolidationTimer` tracking branch age and transition timings
2. Automatic state transitions: WorkingMemory(30s) → ShortTerm(1h) → Consolidating(24h) → LongTerm
3. `StateTransitionEvent` system for triggering consolidation processes
4. Background task scheduler using tokio for transition management
5. Integration with Phase 3 inheritance system for consolidation triggers

Biological Timing Requirements:
- Working Memory: 0-30 seconds (active editing)
- Short-term: 30 seconds - 1 hour (recent changes)
- Consolidating: 1-24 hours (compression phase)
- Long-term: >24 hours (stable storage)

Expected Output: src/temporal/branch/consolidation.rs with background task management
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] State transitions occur at exact time boundaries
- [ ] Background tasks don't impact performance
- [ ] Events trigger appropriate consolidation processes
- [ ] State machine is deterministic and testable
- [ ] Integration with existing inheritance system

### Task 1.5: Branch Testing Suite (1 hour)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Create comprehensive test suite for branch management system. Implement:

1. Unit tests for all data structures and operations
2. Integration tests with Phase 2 allocation engine
3. Performance benchmarks measuring branch creation, switching, and memory usage
4. Concurrent access tests with multiple threads
5. Memory leak detection tests for long-running operations

Test Coverage Requirements:
- Branch lifecycle (create, modify, delete)
- COW semantics verification
- State transition timing accuracy
- Neural pathway integration
- Error handling and recovery

Expected Output: tests/temporal/branch_management_tests.rs with >95% code coverage
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Memory usage validates COW behavior
- [ ] Concurrent tests detect race conditions
- [ ] Integration tests verify neural pathway storage
