# Micro Phase 3: Memory Consolidation Engine

**Duration**: 1 day  
**Prerequisites**: Micro Phase 1 (Branch Management), Micro Phase 2 (Version Chain)  
**Goal**: Implement biological memory consolidation with automatic optimization

## AI-Executable Task Breakdown

### Task 3.1: Consolidation State Management (2 hours)

**Specific Prompt for AI**:
```
Implement biological memory consolidation state tracking. Create:

1. `MemoryStateManager` tracking consolidation timers and state transitions
2. `ConsolidationTimer` with precise timing for each consolidation phase
3. `StateTransitionEvent` system triggering consolidation processes
4. Background scheduler using tokio for automatic state updates
5. Integration with branch lifecycle from Micro Phase 1

Biological State Transitions:

- ShortTerm (30s-1h): Light consolidation, remove obvious redundancy  
- Consolidating (1h-24h): Active consolidation, merge similar concepts
- LongTerm (>24h): Deep consolidation, maximum compression

Expected Output: src/temporal/consolidation/state_manager.rs
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] State transitions occur at exact biological timing intervals
- [ ] Background tasks don't impact foreground performance
- [ ] Multiple branches can be in different consolidation states
- [ ] State changes trigger appropriate consolidation processes
