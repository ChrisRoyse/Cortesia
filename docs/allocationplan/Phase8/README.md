# Phase 8 Micro-Tasks: Complete MCP Server Implementation

This directory contains a detailed breakdown of Phase 8 into granular, AI-actionable micro-tasks. Each micro-task is designed to be completed in 15-20 minutes by an AI agent with clear specifications and success criteria.

## Execution Overview

The implementation consists of **~170 micro-tasks** organized into 9 focused areas:

1. **MicroPhase_1_Foundation** (18 micro-tasks) - Core MCP server setup and dependencies
2. **MicroPhase_2_Neuromorphic_Core** (26 micro-tasks) - Cortical columns and neural networks
3. **MicroPhase_3_Tool_Schemas** (25 micro-tasks) - MCP tool definitions and validation
4. **MicroPhase_4_Tool_Implementation** (25 micro-tasks) - Core tool handlers and logic
5. **MicroPhase_5_Authentication** (15 micro-tasks) - Security and OAuth integration
6. **MicroPhase_6_Performance** (16 micro-tasks) - SIMD optimization and connection pooling
7. **MicroPhase_7_Testing** (18 micro-tasks) - Comprehensive test suite
8. **MicroPhase_8_Integration** (12 micro-tasks) - System integration and deployment
9. **MicroPhase_9_Documentation** (13 micro-tasks) - Final documentation and examples

## Micro-Task Format

Each micro-task follows this structure:
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes maximum
- **Scope**: Single, focused objective
- **Dependencies**: Clearly defined prerequisites
- **Deliverables**: Specific, measurable outputs
- **Success Criteria**: Objective completion metrics

## Task Completion Criteria

Each micro-task must achieve:
- ✅ 15-20 minute completion time
- ✅ 100% functional implementation
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Code quality standards met

## Execution Guidance

### Sequential Execution
- Execute micro-phases in order (1-9)
- Complete all micro-tasks within a phase before moving to the next
- Each micro-task builds upon previous work incrementally
- Dependencies are clearly marked in each task description

### Quality Assurance
- Validate completion criteria after each micro-task
- Run incremental tests to catch issues early
- Maintain documentation synchronization throughout
- Perform integration testing after each micro-phase

### Progress Tracking
- **Total Progress**: ~170 micro-tasks completed
- **Phase Progress**: Track completion within each of the 9 phases
- **Time Estimation**: 42-57 hours total (170 × 15-20 minutes)
- **Checkpoint Reviews**: After phases 3, 6, and 9

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Response time: <100ms per operation
- Throughput: >1000 operations/minute  
- Memory usage: <2GB for 1M memories
- Concurrent connections: >100 simultaneous

### Quality Targets
- Test coverage: >95% across all components
- Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation: 100% API coverage
- Micro-task completion rate: 100% within time limits

### Delivery Targets
- All 170 micro-tasks completed successfully
- Full MCP server implementation operational
- Production-ready deployment configuration
- Comprehensive testing and documentation suite
