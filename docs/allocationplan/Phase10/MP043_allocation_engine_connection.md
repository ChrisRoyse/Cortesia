# MP043: Allocation Engine Connection

## Task Description
Connect graph algorithm processing with the allocation engine to optimize memory allocation patterns based on graph topology.

## Prerequisites
- MP001-MP040 completed
- Phase 2 allocation engine implementation
- Understanding of memory allocation strategies

## Detailed Steps

1. Create `src/neuromorphic/integration/allocation_graph_connector.rs`

2. Implement graph-guided allocation strategy:
   ```rust
   pub struct GraphGuidedAllocator {
       allocation_engine: AllocationEngine,
       graph_analyzer: GraphTopologyAnalyzer,
       locality_optimizer: LocalityOptimizer,
       allocation_history: AllocationHistory,
   }
   
   impl GraphGuidedAllocator {
       pub fn allocate_with_topology(&mut self, 
                                   concept: ConceptRequest,
                                   graph_context: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> Result<AllocationResult, AllocationError> {
           // Analyze graph structure around concept
           let topology_info = self.graph_analyzer.analyze_local_topology(
               &concept.location_hint, graph_context)?;
           
           // Optimize allocation based on connectivity patterns
           let optimal_location = self.locality_optimizer.find_optimal_location(
               &concept, &topology_info)?;
           
           // Perform allocation with graph-aware strategy
           self.allocation_engine.allocate_at_location(concept, optimal_location)
       }
   }
   ```

3. Implement connectivity-aware memory management:
   ```rust
   pub struct ConnectivityAnalyzer {
       centrality_cache: HashMap<NodeId, CentralityMetrics>,
       cluster_map: HashMap<NodeId, ClusterId>,
   }
   
   impl ConnectivityAnalyzer {
       pub fn analyze_allocation_impact(&self, 
                                      proposed_location: NodeId,
                                      graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> AllocationImpact {
           let centrality = self.calculate_node_centrality(proposed_location, graph);
           let cluster_density = self.calculate_local_density(proposed_location, graph);
           let connectivity_score = self.calculate_connectivity_score(proposed_location, graph);
           
           AllocationImpact {
               centrality_impact: centrality,
               density_impact: cluster_density,
               connectivity_impact: connectivity_score,
               predicted_access_frequency: self.predict_access_frequency(proposed_location),
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. Add allocation optimization based on graph algorithms:
   ```rust
   pub struct AllocationOptimizer {
       shortest_path_cache: HashMap<(NodeId, NodeId), PathLength>,
       community_detector: CommunityDetector,
   }
   
   impl AllocationOptimizer {
       pub fn optimize_allocation_placement(&mut self, 
                                          concepts: &[ConceptRequest],
                                          graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> Result<Vec<AllocationPlan>, OptimizationError> {
           // Detect communities for locality optimization
           let communities = self.community_detector.detect_communities(graph)?;
           
           let mut allocation_plans = Vec::new();
           
           for concept in concepts {
               // Find best community for concept based on semantic similarity
               let target_community = self.find_best_community(&concept, &communities)?;
               
               // Find optimal position within community
               let optimal_position = self.find_optimal_position_in_community(
                   &concept, target_community, graph)?;
               
               allocation_plans.push(AllocationPlan {
                   concept_id: concept.id,
                   target_location: optimal_position,
                   community_id: target_community.id,
                   optimization_score: self.calculate_optimization_score(optimal_position, graph),
               });
           }
           
           Ok(allocation_plans)
       }
   }
   ```

5. Implement allocation feedback loop with graph metrics:
   ```rust
   pub struct AllocationFeedbackSystem {
       performance_monitor: AllocationPerformanceMonitor,
       graph_metrics_collector: GraphMetricsCollector,
       adaptation_engine: AdaptationEngine,
   }
   
   impl AllocationFeedbackSystem {
       pub fn collect_allocation_feedback(&mut self, 
                                        allocation_result: &AllocationResult,
                                        graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> Result<FeedbackMetrics, FeedbackError> {
           // Measure actual performance vs predicted
           let actual_performance = self.performance_monitor.measure_access_patterns(allocation_result)?;
           
           // Collect graph-based metrics
           let graph_metrics = self.graph_metrics_collector.collect_post_allocation_metrics(
               allocation_result.location, graph)?;
           
           // Calculate feedback for adaptation
           let feedback = FeedbackMetrics {
               allocation_accuracy: self.calculate_accuracy_score(&actual_performance),
               locality_effectiveness: graph_metrics.locality_score,
               clustering_impact: graph_metrics.clustering_coefficient_change,
               connectivity_utilization: graph_metrics.connectivity_utilization,
           };
           
           // Adapt allocation strategy based on feedback
           self.adaptation_engine.adapt_strategy(&feedback)?;
           
           Ok(feedback)
       }
   }
   ```

## Expected Output
```rust
pub trait GraphAllocationIntegration {
    fn allocate_with_graph_guidance(&mut self, concept: ConceptRequest, graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> Result<AllocationResult, AllocationError>;
    fn optimize_existing_allocations(&mut self, graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> Result<OptimizationResult, OptimizationError>;
    fn predict_allocation_performance(&self, location: NodeId, graph: &NeuromorphicGraph) -> PredictionResult;
}

pub struct GraphAllocationBridge {
    allocator: GraphGuidedAllocator,
    analyzer: ConnectivityAnalyzer,
    optimizer: AllocationOptimizer,
    feedback_system: AllocationFeedbackSystem,
}
```

## Verification Steps
1. Test allocation quality improvement with graph guidance vs baseline
2. Verify locality optimization reduces access latency by >20%
3. Benchmark allocation decision time (< 10ms per concept)
4. Test adaptation effectiveness over multiple allocation cycles
5. Validate memory utilization efficiency with graph-guided placement
