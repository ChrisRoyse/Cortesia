# Phase 10: Advanced Algorithms - Micro-Phase Breakdown

## Overview
This directory contains the detailed breakdown of Phase 10 (Advanced Algorithms) into micro-phases. Each micro-phase represents a small, focused task that can be completed independently by an AI assistant.

## Execution Order
The micro-phases should be executed in the following sequence:

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup (MP001-MP010)
Basic infrastructure and prerequisite implementations

### Stage 2: Core Algorithm Implementation (MP011-MP040)
Implementation of advanced graph algorithms and neural processing

### Stage 3: Integration & Optimization (MP041-MP060)
Connecting algorithms with existing systems and performance tuning

### Stage 4: Testing & Validation (MP061-MP080)
Comprehensive testing of all implemented algorithms

### Stage 5: Documentation & Finalization (MP081-MP090)
Final documentation and system integration verification

## File Structure
- `MP001-MP010/` - Foundation Setup Tasks
- `MP011-MP040/` - Core Algorithm Tasks

## Success Criteria
Each micro-phase must:
1. Be completable in under 30 minutes
2. Have clear, measurable outputs
3. Include verification steps
4. Be independent or have clearly defined dependencies
