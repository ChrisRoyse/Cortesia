## Task Execution Guidelines

### For AI Agents Executing These Tasks

1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete phases in order (6.1 ‚Üí 6.2 ‚Üí 6.3 ‚Üí 6.4 ‚Üí 6.5 ‚Üí 6.6)
2. **Task Dependencies**: Complete all tasks within a phase before proceeding
3. **Quality Standards**: Each task must meet its success criteria before marking complete
4. **Integration Requirements**: Maintain compatibility with existing neuromorphic system
5. **Performance Targets**: All implementations must meet specified performance metrics

### Performance Targets (Must Be Met)

| Metric | Target | Validation Method |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Belief Revision Latency | <5ms | Benchmark tests |
| Context Switch Time | <1ms | Performance monitoring |
| Conflict Detection | <2ms | Stress testing |
| Resolution Success Rate | >95% | Scenario validation |
| Consistency Maintenance | >99% | Property-based testing |
| Memory Overhead | <10% | Resource monitoring |

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc for all public APIs
- **Testing**: >95% code coverage with unit, integration, and scenario tests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with actionable messages
- **Performance**: All operations must meet specified latency targets
- **Integration**: Seamless operation with existing neuromorphic system
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for all critical operations

## Integration Points

### With Existing System Components

1. **Neuromorphic Core** (`src/core/brain_enhanced_graph/`)
   - Spike pattern integration for belief representation
   - Cortical column assignment for parallel processing
   - TTFS encoding preservation during TMS operations

2. **Temporal Versioning** (`src/versioning/`)
   - Integration with existing temporal branch management
   - Belief evolution tracking with version history
   - Time-travel query compatibility

3. **Entity Management** (`src/core/entity.rs`)
   - TMS validation for entity operations
   - Conflict detection during entity updates
   - Consistency enforcement for entity relationships

4. **Query Engine** (`src/core/brain_enhanced_graph/brain_query_engine.rs`)
   - Result validation through TMS
   - Consensus verification for query responses
   - Temporal query enhancement

## Validation Checkpoints

### Phase Completion Criteria

Each micro-phase must satisfy:

- [ ] All individual task success criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests confirm compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code follows existing project conventions

### Overall Phase 6 Success Criteria

- [ ] Hybrid JTMS-ATMS architecture fully operational
- [ ] AGM belief revision with epistemic entrenchment
- [ ] Multi-dimensional conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Temporal reasoning with time-travel capabilities
- [ ] Neuromorphic integration preserves timing properties
- [ ] Production deployment procedures validated
- [ ] All performance targets achieved or exceeded

## Getting Started

1. **Preparation**: Ensure Phase 5 (Temporal Versioning) is complete
2. **Environment**: Set up development environment with test data
3. **Execution**: Begin with `01_Foundation_Setup.md` Task 6.1.1
4. **Validation**: Run tests after each task completion
5. **Monitoring**: Track progress against performance metrics

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Integration conflicts with existing neuromorphic components
- Performance bottlenecks in spike pattern processing
- Memory usage exceeding overhead targets
- Test failures in concurrent access scenarios

### Resolution Strategies
- Refer to existing codebase patterns for integration
- Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks
- Implement memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
- Use proper synchronization primitives for concurrent access
