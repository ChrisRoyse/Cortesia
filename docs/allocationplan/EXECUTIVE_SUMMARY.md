# CortexKG: Neuromorphic Allocation-First Knowledge Graph Platform
## Executive Summary with Advanced Neural Network Integration

### Project Overview

**CortexKG** represents a revolutionary neuromorphic approach to knowledge management, implementing allocation-first principles through advanced spiking neural networks. Rather than asking "Is this information valid?" (validation-first), CortexKG asks "Where does this information belong?" (allocation-first) using Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding and lateral inhibition circuits, fundamentally changing how we store, organize, and retrieve knowledge with biological accuracy.

### Core Innovation: The Allocation-First Paradigm

Traditional knowledge systems follow a validation-first approach:
1. Receive information
2. Validate correctness and relevance  
3. Store if valid
4. Query through search

CortexKG implements allocation-first processing:
1. Receive information
2. **Allocate** to appropriate cortical column
3. Let spreading activation naturally handle retrieval
4. Validation emerges from allocation quality

This neuromorphic paradigm shift enables:
- **10x Knowledge Compression** through neural inheritance hierarchies
- **Sub-1ms Allocation Response** via TTFS spike encoding
- **Emergent Intelligence** through spiking cortical column interactions
- **Biological Accuracy** through lateral inhibition and refractory periods
- **SIMD Acceleration** with 4x parallel processing speedup
- **Neuromorphic Hardware Readiness** for future chip acceleration
