# Phase 1: Spiking Neural Cortical Column Core - Micro Task Breakdown

**Duration**: 7 days  
**Goal**: Implement production-ready spiking neural cortical columns with TTFS encoding and lateral inhibition  
**Critical Success Factors**: Sub-millisecond allocation, winner-take-all dynamics, biological accuracy  

## Overview

Phase 1 implements the core neuromorphic cortical column system that forms the foundation for all subsequent phases. This is broken down into 14 micro-tasks, each designed to be completed by an AI assistant in 2-6 hours.

## Micro Task Structure

Each micro-task includes:
- **Specification**: Precise technical requirements
- **AI-Executable Tests**: Complete test suite to verify success
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step coding instructions
- **Success Criteria**: Quantifiable metrics for completion
- **Dependencies**: Which previous tasks must be finished

## Critical Performance Targets (Revised for Neural Network Integration)

All micro-tasks must collectively achieve:
- [ ] Single allocation < 20ms (p99) - realistic with neural inference pipeline
- [ ] Neural network inference < 5ms - MLP+LSTM+TCN processing time
- [ ] Lateral inhibition convergence < 500μs (maintained - achievable)
- [ ] Memory per column < 512 bytes (maintained - achievable)
- [ ] Winner-take-all accuracy > 98% (maintained - achievable)
- [ ] Thread safety: 0 race conditions (maintained - critical)
- [ ] SIMD acceleration functional (maintained - achievable)

**Performance Target Rationale:**
- **Original Issue**: 5ms target was unrealistic for neural network integration
- **Neural Network Cost**: Three networks (MLP+LSTM+TCN) require minimum ~450μs even with SIMD optimizations
- **Additional Processing**: Spatial indexing (~100μs), lateral inhibition (~300μs), winner-take-all (~100μs)
- **System Overhead**: Thread contention, memory allocation, error handling (~500-1000μs)
- **Revised Target**: 20ms P99 provides 10x buffer for production reliability and variance

## Neural Network Architecture Selection (Intelligence Over Comprehensiveness)

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: The ruv-FANN library provides 29 neural network architectures as OPTIONS. Phase 1 implements intelligent SELECTION of 1-4 optimal types rather than comprehensive coverage.

**Selected Architectures for Phase 1** (based on benchmarking from Phase 0):
1. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** - Architecture #1 for semantic processing
2. **LSTM** - Architecture #4 for temporal sequences (if needed)
3. **TCN** - Architecture #20 as performance alternative (if benchmarks justify)

**Selection Criteria Applied**:
- **Memory Usage**: < 200KB per neural network instance (total budget: ~400KB for all networks)
- **Inference Time**: < 1ms combined for all three networks (realistic with SIMD optimization)
- **WASM Compatibility**: > 90% compatibility for web deployment readiness
- **Accuracy Improvement**: > 5% over baseline single-network approach
- **Production Stability**: Proven architectures with extensive real-world validation

## Quality Gates

Each micro-task must pass:
1. **All tests green** (100% pass rate)
2. **Performance benchmarks met** (within 10% of targets)
3. **Memory usage verified** (no leaks in 1000-iteration test)
4. **Code quality** (clippy warnings = 0)
5. **Documentation** (every public function documented)

## Next Steps

Complete these micro-tasks in order. Each builds on the previous ones. Phase 2 cannot begin until all 14 tasks are completed and verified.
