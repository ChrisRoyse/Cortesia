# Neural Network Architecture Selection Framework

**Duration**: Continuous throughout Phase 1  
**Integration Point**: All tasks must consider neural network requirements  
**Critical Decision**: Select 1-4 optimal architectures from ruv-FANN's 29 options  

## Objective

Implement an intelligent selection framework that chooses the optimal neural network architectures for the cortical column system, prioritizing performance, memory efficiency, and biological accuracy over comprehensive coverage.

## Philosophy: Intelligence Over Comprehensiveness

**Core Principle**: The ruv-FANN library provides 29 neural network architectures as a TOOLKIT. Our system should intelligently SELECT the most effective subset rather than implementing all options.

       let mlp = ruv_fann::load_architecture(1).unwrap();
       let lstm = ruv_fann::load_architecture(4).unwrap();
       let tcn = ruv_fann::load_architecture(20).unwrap();
       
       assert!(mlp.inference_time() < Duration::from_millis(1));
       assert!(lstm.memory_usage() < 200_000);
       assert!(tcn.wasm_compatibility() > 0.9);
   }
   ```

2. **Performance Benchmark Test**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_neural_performance_targets() {
       let allocator = NeuromorphicAllocator::with_selected_architectures();
       
       let start = Instant::now();
       let result = allocator.allocate_concept(test_concept);
       let elapsed = start.elapsed();
       
       assert!(elapsed < Duration::from_millis(5)); // Phase 1 target
       assert!(result.accuracy > 0.95);
   }
   ```

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_neural_memory_budget() {
       let system = CorticalColumnSystem::new();
       let memory_usage = system.total_neural_memory();
       
       assert!(memory_usage < 400_000); // < 400KB budget
