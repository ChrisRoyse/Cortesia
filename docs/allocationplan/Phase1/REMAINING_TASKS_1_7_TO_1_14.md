## Integration Requirements

Each task must:

1. **Build on Previous Tasks**: Use components from earlier tasks
2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Don't break existing interfaces
3. **Pass All Tests**: Comprehensive test suites for each component
4. **Meet Performance Targets**: Verify against Phase 1 requirements
5. **Document APIs**: Full rustdoc documentation

## Critical Dependencies

```
