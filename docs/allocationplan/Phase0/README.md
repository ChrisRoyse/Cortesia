# Phase 0: Neuromorphic Foundation Setup - Micro-Phase Breakdown

This directory contains the detailed micro-phase breakdown for Phase 0, which establishes the neuromorphic foundation for CortexKG. Each micro-phase is designed as a small, focused task that can be executed quickly by AI agents.

## Overview

Phase 0 is divided into 8 major work streams, containing 27 micro-tasks optimized for 20-35 minute execution:

1. **0.1 Project Structure Setup** (4 tasks - Day 1 Morning)
2. **0.2 Neuromorphic Core Data Structures** (5 tasks - Day 1-2)
3. **0.3 TTFS-Encoded Concepts** (4 tasks - Day 2-3)
4. **0.4 Memory Branches** (3 tasks - Day 3-4)
5. **0.5 Mock Infrastructure** (4 tasks - Day 4)
6. **0.6 Benchmark Framework** (3 tasks - Day 5 Morning)
7. **0.7 CI/CD and Automation** (5 tasks - Day 5-6)
8. **0.8 Integration Validation** (3 tasks - Day 6-7)

## Execution Guidelines

Each micro-phase file contains:
- **Objective**: Clear single goal
- **Prerequisites**: What must be completed first
- **Input**: Required files/data
- **Output**: Expected deliverables
- **Verification**: How to confirm completion
- **Time Estimate**: Expected duration (15-60 minutes)
- **AI Prompt**: Ready-to-use prompt for AI execution

## Task Dependencies

The micro-phases must be executed in sequence within each work stream, but some work streams can be parallelized:

```
0.1.1 → 0.1.2 → 0.1.3 → 0.1.4
         ↓
0.2.1 → 0.2.2 → 0.2.3 → 0.2.4 → 0.2.5
         ↓
0.3.1 → 0.3.2 → 0.3.3 → 0.3.4
         ↓
0.4.1 → 0.4.2 → 0.4.3
         ↓
0.5.1 → 0.5.2 → 0.5.3 → 0.5.4
         ↓
0.6.1 → 0.6.2 → 0.6.3
         ↓
0.7.1 → 0.7.2 → 0.7.3 → 0.7.4 → 0.7.5
         ↓
0.8.1 → 0.8.2 → 0.8.3
```

## Success Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:
- ✅ All micro-phases have been executed
- ✅ All verification tests pass
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline is operational
- ✅ Benchmark baseline established
- ✅ Documentation complete

## AI Agent Instructions

To execute a micro-phase:
1. Read the specific micro-phase file (e.g., `0.1.1_create_workspace.md`)
2. Verify all prerequisites are met
3. Execute the task as specified
4. Run verification steps
5. Mark as complete and proceed to next task

## Integration Validation (Work Stream 0.8)

The new integration validation work stream ensures comprehensive quality assurance:

- **0.8.1 Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation, cross-crate interaction tests, and mock-to-real transition readiness
- **0.8.2 Dependency Validation**: Automated prerequisite checking, completion criteria validation, and rollback mechanisms
- **0.8.3 AI Prompt Validation**: Syntax checking, compilation testing, and execution reliability for all AI prompts

## Quality Gates

Each micro-phase includes specific quality gates that must pass:
- Code compiles without warnings
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- Documentation updated (including CLAUDE.md synchronization)
- No regression in existing functionality
- Integration validation requirements met
