## Prerequisites
- Basic CI workflow setup (0.7.1 complete)
- Project structure established

## Input
- Cargo workspace configuration
- Security audit requirements
- Dependency management needs

## Task Details

### Step 1: Create Security Audit Workflow
Setup automated security auditing with cargo-audit integration.

### Step 2: Add Dependency Update Automation
Implement weekly dependency updates with automated testing.

### Step 3: Create Security Issue Templates
Add GitHub issue templates for security-related reporting.

## Expected Output

## Verification Steps
1. Verify security audit runs in CI
2. Test dependency update workflow
3. Check issue template functionality
4. Confirm vulnerability detection works

## Time Estimate
20-25 minutes

## AI Execution Prompt
```
Setup security auditing and dependency management workflows.

1. Add security audit job to .github/workflows/ci.yml:

```yaml
  security:
    name: Security Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install Rust toolchain
      uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

    - name: Install cargo-audit
      run: cargo install cargo-audit

    - name: Run security audit
      run: cargo audit
```

2. Create .github/workflows/dependency-update.yml:

```yaml
name: Dependency Updates

on:
  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Sundays at 3 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 3 * * 0'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-dependencies:
    name: Update Dependencies
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Install Rust toolchain
      uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

    - name: Install cargo-update
      run: cargo install cargo-update

    - name: Update dependencies
      run: |
        cargo update
        cargo check --workspace

    - name: Run tests with updated dependencies
      run: cargo test --workspace

    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        commit-message: "chore: update dependencies"
        title: "Automated dependency updates"
        body: |
          This is an automated pull request to update project dependencies.
          
          Please review the changes and ensure all tests pass before merging.
          
          Changes made by cargo update.
        branch: automated/dependency-updates
        delete-branch: true
```

3. Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory:
   mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

4. Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_vulnerability.md:

```markdown
---
name: Security Vulnerability
about: Report a security vulnerability in the codebase
title: 'Security: [VULNERABILITY TYPE]'
labels: ['security', 'vulnerability', 'priority-critical']
assignees: ''

---
