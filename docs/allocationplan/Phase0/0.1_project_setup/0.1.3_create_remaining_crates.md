# Micro-Phase 0.1.3: Create Remaining Crates

## Objective
Create the remaining 5 library crates for the CortexKG workspace with their initial configurations.

## Prerequisites
- Workspace Cargo.toml created (0.1.1 complete)
- neuromorphic-core crate created (0.1.2 complete)

## Input
- Workspace root directory
- Crate names and purposes from Phase 0 specification

## Task Details

### Step 1: Create SNN Allocation Engine Crate
Create the crate for spiking neural allocation logic.

### Step 2: Create Temporal Memory Crate
Create the crate for versioning and memory consolidation.

### Step 3: Create Neural Bridge Crate
Create the crate for cross-database pattern detection.

### Step 4: Create Neuromorphic WASM Crate
Create the crate for WASM bindings and SIMD optimization.

### Step 5: Create SNN Mocks Crate
Create the crate for testing infrastructure.

## Expected Output
- 5 additional crate directories created under `crates/`
- Each crate has configured Cargo.toml
- Each crate has initial lib.rs
- All crates pass `cargo check`

## Verification Steps
1. Run `cargo check` from workspace root - all crates compile
2. Verify each crate has proper workspace inheritance
3. Check that each lib.rs has module documentation
4. Confirm no duplicate crate names

## Time Estimate
20-30 minutes

## AI Execution Prompt
```
Create the remaining 5 crates for the CortexKG neuromorphic system.

For each crate below, execute these steps:
1. Create the crate: cargo new --lib crates/<crate-name>
2. Configure its Cargo.toml with workspace inheritance
3. Add appropriate dependencies
4. Create initial lib.rs with documentation

CRATE 1: snn-allocation-engine
- Purpose: Spiking neural allocation logic
- Dependencies: 
  - neuromorphic-core = { path = "../neuromorphic-core" }
  - tokio.workspace = true
  - dashmap.workspace = true
- lib.rs content:
  ```rust
  //! Spiking Neural Network allocation engine
  //! 
  //! Implements TTFS-based allocation with lateral inhibition.
  
  pub mod snn_allocator;
  pub mod lateral_inhibition;
  pub mod ttfs_encoder;
  pub mod cortical_voting;
  ```

CRATE 2: temporal-memory
- Purpose: Memory versioning and consolidation
- Dependencies:
  - neuromorphic-core = { path = "../neuromorphic-core" }
  - chrono.workspace = true
  - serde.workspace = true
- lib.rs content:
  ```rust
  //! Temporal memory management
  //! 
  //! Handles memory branches and consolidation states.
  
  pub mod branch;
  pub mod consolidation;
  ```

CRATE 3: neural-bridge  
- Purpose: Cross-database pattern detection
- Dependencies:
  - neuromorphic-core = { path = "../neuromorphic-core" }
  - dashmap.workspace = true
- lib.rs content:
  ```rust
  //! Neural bridge for pattern emergence
  //! 
  //! Detects patterns across different knowledge bases.
  
  pub mod bridge;
  pub mod emergence;
  ```

CRATE 4: neuromorphic-wasm
- Purpose: WASM bindings with SIMD
- Dependencies:
  - neuromorphic-core = { path = "../neuromorphic-core" }
  - snn-allocation-engine = { path = "../snn-allocation-engine" }
  - wasm-bindgen.workspace = true
  - web-sys.workspace = true
- Add to Cargo.toml:
  [lib]
  crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
- lib.rs content:
  ```rust
  //! WASM bindings for neuromorphic processing
  //! 
  //! Provides web-compatible interface with SIMD acceleration.
  
  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  
  pub mod simd_bindings;
  pub mod snn_wasm;
  pub mod ttfs_wasm;
  ```

CRATE 5: snn-mocks
- Purpose: Testing mocks
- Dependencies:
  - neuromorphic-core = { path = "../neuromorphic-core" }
  - snn-allocation-engine = { path = "../snn-allocation-engine" }
  - tokio.workspace = true
  - rand = "0.8"
- lib.rs content:
  ```rust
  //! Mock implementations for testing
  //! 
  //! Provides test doubles for SNN components.
  
  pub mod mock_snn_column;
  pub mod mock_ttfs_allocator;
  pub mod mock_inhibition;
  pub mod mock_simd;
  ```

After creating all crates, run `cargo check` from the workspace root to verify everything compiles.
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 5 crates created with proper structure
- [ ] Each Cargo.toml uses workspace inheritance
- [ ] Dependencies correctly specified
- [ ] Module documentation in each lib.rs
- [ ] Workspace-level `cargo check` passes
