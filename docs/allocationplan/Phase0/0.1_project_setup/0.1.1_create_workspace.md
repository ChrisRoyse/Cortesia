# Micro-Phase 0.1.1: Create Rust Workspace

## Objective
Create the base Rust workspace structure with proper configuration for the CortexKG neuromorphic system.

## Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain installed (rustc, cargo)
- Git initialized in project root
- Write access to project directory

## Input
- Project root directory path
- Workspace member names from Phase 0 specification

## Task Details

### Step 1: Create Workspace Cargo.toml
Create the root `Cargo.toml` file with workspace configuration.

### Step 2: Set Workspace Metadata
Configure workspace-wide settings including version, authors, edition, and license.

### Step 3: Add Core Dependencies
Add the essential dependencies that will be shared across all crates.

### Step 4: Configure Optimization Settings
Set up release profile for optimal performance.

## Expected Output
- `CortexKG/Cargo.toml` file created
- Workspace configuration complete
- No compilation errors when running `cargo check`

## Verification Steps
1. Run `cargo check` - should succeed with no errors
2. Verify Cargo.toml contains all required workspace members
3. Verify workspace dependencies section includes core deps
4. Check that resolver = "2" is set

## Time Estimate
15-20 minutes

## AI Execution Prompt
```
Create a Rust workspace for the CortexKG neuromorphic system with explicit file creation and complete dependency specification.

1. Create the root workspace Cargo.toml file:
   
   Create file: CortexKG/Cargo.toml
   
   Content:
   ```toml
   [workspace]
   members = [
       "crates/neuromorphic-core",
       "crates/snn-allocation-engine", 
       "crates/temporal-memory",
       "crates/neural-bridge",
       "crates/neuromorphic-wasm",
       "crates/snn-mocks",
   ]
   resolver = "2"

   [workspace.package]
   version = "0.1.0"
   authors = ["CortexKG Team"]
   edition = "2021"
   license = "MIT"

   [workspace.dependencies]
   # Core async runtime and concurrency (ALL PHASES)
   tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full", "tracing"] }
   async-trait = "0.1"
   futures = "0.3"
   rayon = "1.0"
   crossbeam = "0.8"
   parking_lot = "0.12"
   once_cell = "1.0"
   dashmap = "5.0"

   # Serialization and data handling (ALL PHASES)
   serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
   serde_json = "1.0"
   bincode = "1.3"
   uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
   chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }

   # Error handling and logging (ALL PHASES)
   anyhow = "1.0"
   thiserror = "1.0"
   tracing = "0.1"
   tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }

   # Neural network framework - select 1-4 optimal types from 29 available (PHASE_1-11)
   candle-core = "0.3"
   candle-nn = "0.3"
   ndarray = "0.15"
   rfann = "0.1"  # 29 available architectures - system selects optimal subset

   # Graph storage and processing (PHASE_2-11)
   petgraph = "0.6"
   sled = "0.34"

   # WASM and SIMD support (PHASE_9-11)
   wasm-bindgen = { version = "0.2", features = ["spans"] }
   js-sys = "0.3"
   web-sys = { version = "0.3", features = ["console"] }

   # Testing and benchmarking (ALL PHASES)
   criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }
   proptest = "1.0"
   mockall = "0.11"
   ```

2. Create the basic directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p crates
   mkdir -p tests
   mkdir -p benches
   mkdir -p docs
   ```

3. Create a basic .gitignore file:
   
   Create file: CortexKG/.gitignore
   
   Content:
   ```gitignore
   # Rust build artifacts
   /target
   /Cargo.lock

   # WASM build artifacts
   /dist
   /pkg
   *.wasm

   # Neural model weights (too large for git)
   /model_weights/*.bin
   /neural_checkpoints/

   # Development
   .DS_Store
   .env
   .vscode/

   # Benchmarking results
   /criterion_outputs/
   /test_outputs/
   ```

4. Verify the workspace configuration:
   ```bash
   cd CortexKG
   cargo check --workspace
   ```

This should create a valid Rust workspace ready for the neuromorphic system development.
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Cargo.toml exists with valid workspace configuration
- [ ] All 6 crate members are listed
- [ ] Core dependencies are specified
- [ ] `cargo check` runs without errors
- [ ] Resolver version 2 is set

## CLAUDE.md Synchronization Requirement
**CRITICAL**: After creating the workspace structure, verify that any existing `claude.md` files in the project root accurately reflect the new workspace configuration. Update documentation if:
- Workspace member crates differ from documented structure
- Dependencies change from documented specifications
- Build configuration differs from documented settings
- Project organization changes from documented architecture
