## Key Innovations

### 1. Temporal Branches as Memory Consolidation
```rust
// Each branch represents a memory state
pub struct MemoryBranch {
    id: BranchId,
    parent: Option<BranchId>,
    timestamp: DateTime,
    consolidation_state: ConsolidationState,
    active_columns: HashSet<ColumnId>,
}

// Memory consolidation over time
pub enum ConsolidationState {
    WorkingMemory,      // < 30 seconds
    ShortTerm,          // < 1 hour
    Consolidating,      // 1-24 hours
    LongTerm,           // > 24 hours
}
```

### 2. Cross-Database Neural Bridges
```rust
// Discover patterns across databases without explicit queries
pub struct NeuralBridge {
    databases: Vec<DatabaseConnection>,
    pattern_detector: PatternDetector,
    
    pub async fn discover_emergent_knowledge(&self) -> Vec<EmergentPattern> {
        // Automatic pattern recognition across branches
        // No embeddings needed - pure structural analysis
    }
}
```

### 3. LLM-Enhanced Allocation
```rust
// Small LLM guides allocation decisions
pub struct IntelligentAllocator {
    cortical_engine: CorticalEngine,
    llm_advisor: SmallLanguageModel,
    
    pub async fn allocate_with_intelligence(&self, fact: &Fact) -> AllocationResult {
        // LLM suggests optimal allocation
        let hint = self.llm_advisor.suggest_allocation(fact).await?;
        
        // Cortical engine executes with hint
        self.cortical_engine.allocate_with_hint(fact, hint).await
    }
}
```

### 4. Episodic vs Semantic Storage
```rust
// Different memory types stored differently
pub enum MemoryType {
    Episodic {
        event_time: DateTime,
        context: EventContext,
        decay_rate: f32,
    },
    Semantic {
        inheritance_chain: Vec<ConceptId>,
        compression_level: u8,
        permanence: f32,
    },
}
```

### 5. Neuromorphic Truth Maintenance System
```rust
// Hybrid JTMS-ATMS with belief revision
pub struct NeuromorphicTMS {
    jtms_layer: JustificationBasedTMS,      // Dependency tracking
    atms_layer: AssumptionBasedTMS,         // Multi-context reasoning
    belief_revision: AGMBeliefRevision,     // Principled belief updates
    
    pub async fn handle_contradiction(&mut self, conflict: &Conflict) -> Resolution {
        // Multi-strategy conflict resolution
        // Source reliability, temporal reasoning, evidence-based
        // All implemented through spiking neural networks
    }
}
```

## Performance Targets (Flexible Goals)

**Note**: These are aspirational targets for a novel neuromorphic system. As this architecture has never been implemented before, actual performance will be discovered through experimentation. The primary goal is to **outperform existing knowledge graph systems** rather than hit specific numbers.

### Comparative Performance Goals

| Operation | Goal | Baseline Comparison |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| Fact Allocation | Better than Neo4j | Neo4j: ~50ms for complex patterns |
| Document Processing | Better than traditional | SQL JOIN: ~200ms for multi-table |
| Cross-DB Pattern | Better than Federation | GraphQL Federation: ~500ms |
| Time-Travel Query | Better than git | Git history: ~100ms for deep search |
| Branch Creation | Better than git branch | Git: ~50ms for large repos |
| LLM Enhancement | Better than API calls | OpenAI API: ~1000ms |
| Belief Revision | <5ms per revision | Traditional TMS: ~20ms |
| Conflict Resolution | >95% success rate | Rule engines: ~80% |
| **Scalable Allocation (Phase 2A)** | **O(log n) scaling** | **Linear search: O(n)** |
| 1M nodes | <1ms allocation | Traditional: ~100ms |
| 100M nodes | <10ms allocation | Traditional: ~10s |
| 1B nodes | <100ms allocation | Traditional: impractical |

### CPU-Optimized Performance

**Important**: All performance targets assume **CPU-only execution** (no GPU required):
- Optimized for modern multi-core CPUs (like Intel i9)
- SIMD acceleration where available
- No CUDA/GPU dependencies
- Parallel processing via CPU threads

### Flexible Benchmarking Philosophy

1. **Relative Performance**: Success = faster than current best-in-class
2. **Progressive Improvement**: Initial versions may be slower, optimize iteratively
3. **Hardware Adaptive**: Performance scales with available CPU cores
4. **No Hard Failures**: Missing targets doesn't break the system
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track trends rather than absolute numbers

## SPARC Methodology

Each phase follows strict SPARC:

1. **Specification**: Define biological inspiration and requirements
2. **Pseudocode**: Algorithm design mimicking brain processes
3. **Architecture**: Component structure following neural patterns
4. **Refinement**: Iterative improvement with performance tests
5. **Completion**: Full implementation with comprehensive tests

## Test-Driven Development

Following London School TDD:

1. **Mock First**: Create mock brain components
2. **Behavior Tests**: Test memory patterns, not implementation
3. **Integration**: Gradually replace mocks with real neurons
4. **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking against brain metrics

2. **Consistent performance** on CPU-only hardware
3. **Scalability** with available resources
4. **User-perceptible** improvements

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Parsing quality failure** | **CRITICAL** | **Phase 0A mandatory quality assurance** |
| LLM latency | High | Local small models, caching |
| Cross-DB complexity | High | Start with 2 DBs, scale gradually |
| Memory usage | Medium | Aggressive pruning, compression |
| WASM performance | Medium | Native fallback, optimization |

## Development Philosophy

"We're not building a database - we're building a brain. Every decision should ask: How does biological memory do this?"

### Core Principles (In Priority Order)

1. **Quality-First Parsing** (Phase 0A) - Without high-quality input parsing, everything fails
2. **Allocation over validation** - The brain allocates first, validates later
3. **Structure over statistics** - Relationships matter more than counts
4. **Emergence over explicit programming** - Let patterns arise naturally
5. **Compression through inheritance** - Biological efficiency through hierarchy
6. **Time as a first-class concept** - Memory is inherently temporal

### Critical Foundation: Parsing Quality Assurance

**Phase 0A is MANDATORY** - The system's intelligence is only as good as its input quality:
- Multi-stage validation pipeline ensures >95% parsing accuracy
- Every fact must have confidence scores and pass quality gates
- Ambiguity resolution prevents confusion in the knowledge graph
- Without this foundation, even perfect neuromorphic processing produces garbage

The allocation-first paradigm only works when we're allocating validated, high-quality facts.

## Operational Monitoring and Health Management

### Neural Health Monitoring System

The CortexKG system includes comprehensive autonomous health monitoring designed for AI-to-AI operation without human intervention. See `NEUROMORPHIC_HEALTH_MONITORING.md` for detailed implementation.

#### Core Monitoring Components

1. **Real-Time Health Metrics**
   - Spike rate monitoring (40-60 Hz healthy range)
   - Refractory violation detection (<0.1% threshold)
   - Allocation latency tracking (<1ms target)
   - Convergence rate analysis (>95% healthy)
   - Memory pressure monitoring (<80% optimal)

2. **Synaptic Weight Drift Detection**
   - Continuous weight stability tracking
   - Drift velocity calculations
   - Pathological pattern recognition
   - Automatic remediation strategies

3. **Performance Degradation Patterns**
   - Early warning system (5%/15%/30% thresholds)
   - Predictive failure analysis (1-hour horizon)
   - Degradation pattern classification
   - Intervention point identification

4. **Maintenance Scheduling**
   - Adaptive maintenance windows
   - Proactive component refresh
   - Load-aware scheduling
   - Emergency maintenance triggers

#### Integration with MCP Tools

```rust
// Health monitoring exposed as MCP tool
pub struct NeuralHealthTool {
    name: "neural_health_monitor",
    description: "Monitor and maintain neural network health",
    actions: ["check_health", "predict_failure", "schedule_maintenance"]
}
```

#### Operational Overhead

- Health monitoring: <0.1% CPU overhead
- Drift detection: <0.5% memory overhead  
- Maintenance windows: 0-20% temporary impact
- Total monitoring cost: <2% performance

### Neural Network Architecture Philosophy

**Important**: The system has access to 29 different neural network architectures through ruv-FANN, but **only 1-3 network types are expected to be used** in practice:

- **LSTM**: For all temporal/sequential processing
- **Standard MLP**: For all classification/transformation tasks  
- **TCN** (optional): For performance-critical paths

The 29 available networks are OPTIONS for future optimization, not requirements. This simplification strategy reduces complexity while maintaining full neuromorphic capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions** (Week 0)
   - Set up development environment per DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_COMPLETE.md
   - Initialize Git repository with branch strategy
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
   - Establish monitoring and alerting baseline

2. **Phase 0 Kickoff** (Week 1, Day 1)
   - Team alignment on biological principles
   - Dependency verification checklist
   - Risk assessment initialization
   - Development environment validation

3. **Continuous Activities**
