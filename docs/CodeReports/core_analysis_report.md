The engine manages the state of entities, applies activation rules, and handles temporal decay and inhibitory connections.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **`ActivationConfig`**: A struct that holds the configuration for the activation propagation, including parameters like `max_iterations`, `convergence_threshold`, `decay_rate`, `inhibition_strength`, and `default_threshold`.
    *   **`PropagationResult`**: A struct that encapsulates the results of the activation propagation, including the final activation states, the number of iterations, whether the simulation converged, and a trace of the activation steps.
    *   **`ActivationPropagationEngine`**: The main struct that manages the activation propagation. It contains the network's entities, logic gates, and relationships, along with the configuration. It provides methods to add components to the network, run the propagation, and retrieve the results.

## Part 2: Directory-Level Summary

## Directory Summary: src/core/

### Overall Purpose and Role

Based on the analysis of all the files, the `src/core/` directory contains the foundational components of the knowledge graph. It provides the core data structures, memory management, and graph operations that are used by the rest of the system. It also includes a brain-enhanced layer that adds cognitive capabilities, such as activation propagation and concept formation, to the traditional knowledge graph.

### Core Files

*   **`src/core/graph/graph_core.rs`**: This file is the heart of the knowledge graph. It defines the main `KnowledgeGraph` struct and brings together all the other components, such as the entity store, the CSR graph, and the various indexes.
*   **`src/core/brain_enhanced_graph/brain_graph_core.rs`**: This file is the core of the brain-enhanced knowledge graph. It extends the traditional knowledge graph with brain-like processing capabilities, such as activation propagation and concept formation.
*   **`src/core/knowledge_engine.rs`**: This file provides a high-performance knowledge engine for storing and retrieving SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object) triples. It is optimized for LLM applications and features automatic embedding generation, fast SPO queries, and semantic search.

### Interaction Patterns

The files in this directory are used by the rest of the application to store, retrieve, and query the knowledge graph. The `KnowledgeEngine` and `BrainEnhancedKnowledgeGraph` structs provide the main entry points to the graph, and the other components are used internally to support their functionality.

### Directory-Wide Testing Strategy

The testing for this directory should focus on verifying the correctness and performance of the knowledge graph as a whole. This includes creating a comprehensive set of integration tests that cover all the major features of the graph, such as entity and relationship management, querying, and activation propagation. It would also be beneficial to create a set of benchmark tests to measure the performance of the graph under various workloads.
