**## File Analysis: src/agents/mod.rs**

**1. Purpose and Functionality**

*   **Agent Role:** Module Definition.
*   **Summary:** This file serves as the root of the `agents` module, declaring the `construction` and `coordination` sub-modules. It defines the core `Agent` trait that all agents in the system must implement, establishing a common interface for their behavior.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **`Agent` Trait:** This trait defines the essential capabilities of an agent. It includes methods for an agent to identify itself (`id`), understand its role (`role`), and execute its primary function (`execute`). The `execute` method is asynchronous and designed to take a `Request` and return a `Response`, indicating a standard communication pattern.

**2. Project Relevance and Dependencies**

*   **Role in Agent Workflow:** This file is foundational. It doesn't represent an agent itself but provides the architectural backbone for all agents. It ensures that any component in the system can interact with any agent through a standardized interface.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Imports:** It imports `AgentId`, `Request`, and `Response` from the parent module's `types`. This shows that agents operate on standardized data structures. It also uses `async_trait` to allow asynchronous methods in the trait.
    *   **Outputs/Exports:** It exports the `Agent` trait and the `construction` and `coordination` modules, making them available to the rest of the application.

**3. Testing Strategy**

*   **Overall Approach:** Since this file primarily defines a trait and module structure, it doesn't have concrete logic to test directly. Testing will focus on the implementations of the `Agent` trait in other modules.
*   **Unit Testing Suggestions:** Not applicable.
*   **Integration Testing Suggestions:** Create tests that ensure different agent implementations correctly adhere to the `Agent` trait's contract. For example, a test could instantiate multiple types of agents and call their `id()`, `role()`, and `execute()` methods to verify they all behave as expected.

**## File Analysis: src/agents/construction.rs**

**1. Purpose and Functionality**

*   **Agent Role:** Construction Agent.
*   **Summary:** This agent is responsible for taking a high-level goal and breaking it down into a series of concrete, executable steps. It acts as the initial planner in the agent workflow.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **`ConstructionAgent` Struct:** This struct holds the agent's unique ID and a `KnowledgeEngine`, which it likely uses to access information or reasoning capabilities to formulate a plan.
    *   **`new()` function:** A simple constructor to create a new `ConstructionAgent`.
    *   **`Agent` Trait Implementation:**
        *   `id()`: Returns the agent's ID.
        *   `role()`: Returns the string "Construction Agent".
        *   `execute()`: This is the core logic. It takes a `Request`, which presumably contains the high-level goal, and returns a `Response` containing the generated plan. The implementation currently returns a hardcoded, placeholder response, indicating it is not yet fully implemented.

**2. Project Relevance and Dependencies**

*   **Role in Agent Workflow:** This is a critical, initial-stage agent. It takes the user's or system's primary objective and creates the structured plan that other agents will follow.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Imports:** It imports the `Agent` trait from its parent module, as well as `KnowledgeEngine` and various types (`AgentId`, `Request`, `Response`, `Task`, `TaskResult`). This shows a tight coupling with the core data structures of the system.
    *   **Outputs/Exports:** It exports the `ConstructionAgent` struct. Its primary output is a `Response` object containing a list of `Task` objects, which will be consumed by the `CoordinationAgent`.

**3. Testing Strategy**

*   **Overall Approach:** Focus on unit testing the plan generation logic and integration testing its handoff to the `CoordinationAgent`.
*   **Unit Testing Suggestions:**
    *   **Prompt/Logic Tests:** Once the `execute` method is implemented, test that for a given high-level goal, the agent produces a well-structured and logical plan. For example, input "Research topic X and write a report" and assert that the output contains tasks for research, synthesis, and writing.
    *   **Tool Usage Tests:** If the agent uses the `KnowledgeEngine`, mock the engine's responses to ensure the agent handles them correctly. For example, simulate the `KnowledgeEngine` returning an error to see if the agent fails gracefully.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Test with ambiguous or nonsensical goals to see how the agent responds. Test what happens if the `KnowledgeEngine` is unavailable.
*   **Integration Testing Suggestions:** Create a test where the `ConstructionAgent` receives a goal, generates a plan, and the resulting `Response` is passed to the `CoordinationAgent`. Assert that the `CoordinationAgent` can correctly parse the plan and begin execution.

**## File Analysis: src/agents/coordination.rs**

**1. Purpose and Functionality**

*   **Agent Role:** Coordination Agent.
*   **Summary:** This agent acts as a project manager or orchestrator. It takes a plan (a list of tasks) and is responsible for executing each task, likely by dispatching them to other specialized agents.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **`CoordinationAgent` Struct:** This struct holds the agent's ID and a `KnowledgeEngine`.
    *   **`new()` function:** A constructor for the `CoordinationAgent`.
    *   **`Agent` Trait Implementation:**
        *   `id()`: Returns the agent's ID.
        *   `role()`: Returns the string "Coordination Agent".
        *   `execute()`: The core logic. It receives a `Request` containing a list of tasks. It then iterates through these tasks, "executing" them one by one. The current implementation is a placeholder that simulates execution by printing the task description and returning a hardcoded success message.

**2. Project Relevance and Dependencies**

*   **Role in Agent Workflow:** This is the central agent that drives the execution of a plan. It sits between the `ConstructionAgent` (which creates the plan) and any specialist agents that would perform the actual work (e.g., research, writing, coding).
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Imports:** Similar to the `ConstructionAgent`, it imports the `Agent` trait and core data structures. Its reliance on `Task` and `TaskResult` is central to its function.
    *   **Outputs/Exports:** It exports the `CoordinationAgent`. Its `execute` method produces a final `Response` that should summarize the results of the entire plan execution.

**3. Testing Strategy**

*   **Overall Approach:** Testing should focus on the agent's ability to correctly sequence tasks, handle task failures, and manage the overall execution flow.
*   **Unit Testing Suggestions:**
    *   **Prompt/Logic Tests:** Test the task execution loop. Provide a list of tasks and verify that the agent attempts to execute them in the correct order.
    *   **Tool Usage Tests:** In a real implementation, this agent would dispatch tasks to other agents. This interaction must be mocked. Create mock specialist agents and verify that the `CoordinationAgent` calls them with the correct task information.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Test with an empty list of tasks. Test how the agent behaves if a task fails mid-plan. Test the agent's response to invalid task data in the `Request`.
*   **Integration Testing Suggestions:**
    *   As mentioned for the `ConstructionAgent`, test the handoff from plan creation to execution.
    *   Create a more complex integration test involving the `CoordinationAgent` and two mock specialist agents (e.g., a `ResearchAgent` and a `WriterAgent`). The `CoordinationAgent` should receive a plan, call the `ResearchAgent`, and then use its output to call the `WriterAgent`, verifying the data flows correctly between them.

**## Agents Directory Summary: ./src/agents/**

*   **Overall Workflow:** The likely end-to-end workflow is as follows:
    1.  A high-level goal is sent as a `Request` to the `ConstructionAgent`.
    2.  The `ConstructionAgent` uses its `KnowledgeEngine` to break the goal down into a structured plan, which is a list of `Task` objects.
    3.  This plan is sent as a `Request` to the `CoordinationAgent`.
    4.  The `CoordinationAgent` iterates through the tasks. For each task, it will eventually dispatch it to a specialized agent (which are not yet defined in this directory).
    5.  The `CoordinationAgent` collects the `TaskResult` from each specialist agent and, upon completion of the plan, returns a final `Response` summarizing the outcome.

*   **Core Agents:**
    1.  **`ConstructionAgent`:** This agent is the most critical for initiating any meaningful work. Without its ability to translate a high-level goal into an actionable plan, the entire system is non-functional.
    2.  **`CoordinationAgent`:** This agent is the engine of the system. It is responsible for executing the plan and managing the flow of work between other agents. Its reliability and error handling are paramount to the success of any multi-step task.

*   **Interaction Patterns:** The primary method of communication is through a standardized request/response pattern using `Request` and `Response` objects. These objects wrap structured data, primarily `Task` and `TaskResult` lists. This creates a formal, decoupled interface between agents, where one agent's output is the next agent's input.

*   **Global Testing Strategy:**
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** The primary E2E testing strategy should focus on validating the entire workflow from goal to final output.
        *   **E2E Test Case 1 (Happy Path):** Define a simple goal like "Explain the concept of photosynthesis." Create a test that sends this goal to the `ConstructionAgent`, takes the resulting plan and sends it to the `CoordinationAgent`, and mocks the specialist agents that would perform the research and writing. The test should assert that the final `Response` from the `CoordinationAgent` indicates success and contains the expected (mocked) output.
        *   **E2E Test Case 2 (Task Failure):** Create a similar E2E test, but configure the mock specialist agent for the second task to return an error. Assert that the `CoordinationAgent` stops execution and returns a `Response` that correctly reports the failure of that specific task.
        *   **E2E Test Case 3 (Invalid Goal):** Send an ambiguous or impossible goal to the `ConstructionAgent`. Assert that it returns a `Response` indicating that a plan could not be created, and that the `CoordinationAgent` is never called.
    *   **Mocking:** All external dependencies, especially the `KnowledgeEngine` and any future specialist agents that make API calls, must be mocked to ensure tests are deterministic, fast, and do not incur costs.
