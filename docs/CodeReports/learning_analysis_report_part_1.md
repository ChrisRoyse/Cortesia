## Directory Summary: ./src/learning/

### Overall Purpose and Role

Based on the analyzed files, the `./src/learning/` directory implements a comprehensive biological learning system that adapts the knowledge graph through multiple complementary mechanisms. The directory provides adaptive learning capabilities that enhance the cognitive architecture with principles derived from neuroscience, including Hebbian learning, synaptic homeostasis, and metaplasticity.

### Core Files

1. **types.rs** - The foundational type system that enables communication between all learning components
2. **hebbian.rs** - The primary learning algorithm implementing biological plasticity principles
3. **homeostasis.rs** - The stability maintenance system preventing pathological network states

### Interaction Patterns

The files in this directory work together to create a multi-layered learning system:
- **types.rs** provides the common language for all learning algorithms
- **hebbian.rs** drives experience-based adaptation of connection strengths
- **homeostasis.rs** maintains system stability during learning
- **mod.rs** orchestrates clean integration and prevents namespace conflicts

### Directory-Wide Testing Strategy

The learning directory requires a comprehensive testing approach that addresses both individual algorithm correctness and system-wide stability:

1. **Algorithm Verification:** Each learning algorithm should be tested independently with controlled inputs
2. **Integration Testing:** Multi-algorithm scenarios should verify that learning systems work harmoniously
3. **Long-term Stability:** Extended learning cycles should demonstrate convergence and stability
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Tests should verify that learning improves system performance over time
5. **Biological Plausibility:** Learning behaviors should align with known neuroscientific principles

The testing strategy should include shared fixtures for generating realistic activation patterns and performance data, as well as integration tests that demonstrate the learning system's ability to improve query performance and user satisfaction over time.
