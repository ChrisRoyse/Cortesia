### 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Primary Role:** Core embedding storage system with quantization integration

**Summary:** This file implements a streamlined embedding storage system that directly integrates with the ProductQuantizer for memory-efficient storage. It provides a simple API for storing and retrieving embeddings with automatic quantization and efficient memory management.

**Key Components:**
- **EmbeddingStore**: Main storage structure containing a thread-safe quantizer, quantized data bank, and dimension tracking
- **store_embedding()**: Stores embeddings by quantizing them and adding to the data bank, returning storage offsets
- **get_embedding()**: Retrieves and reconstructs embeddings from quantized codes using the integrated quantizer
- **asymmetric_distance()**: Computes distances directly against quantized representations without full reconstruction
- **Memory management**: Tracks memory usage across quantized bank and quantizer codebooks

### 2. Project Relevance and Dependencies

**Architectural Role:** This store serves as a lightweight, performance-focused embedding storage solution designed for scenarios where maximum memory efficiency is critical. It's optimized for write-once, read-many workloads with minimal overhead.

**Dependencies:**

- **Exports:** EmbeddingStore as the primary storage interface for the embedding subsystem

### 3. Testing Strategy

**Overall Approach:** This file requires focused testing on storage correctness, memory efficiency, and concurrent access patterns. Emphasis should be on data integrity and performance under load.

**Unit Testing Suggestions:**
- **store_embedding()**: 
  - Happy Path: Store valid embeddings and verify correct offset returns and memory tracking

### 2. Project Relevance and Dependencies

**Architectural Role:** This store acts as the main embedding interface for performance testing and production workloads requiring backward compatibility. It bridges the gap between legacy APIs and modern quantization features while providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

**Dependencies:**
- **Imports:** Uses `std::collections::HashMap`, `crate::core::types::EntityKey`, `crate::core::entity_compat::SimilarityResult`, quantizer and error modules
- **Exports:** EmbeddingStore, MemoryStats, and ProductQuantizer compatibility extensions for broader system integration

### 3. Testing Strategy

**Overall Approach:** This file requires extensive testing covering compatibility requirements, automatic quantization behavior, and performance characteristics. Focus on maintaining API contracts while validating quantization benefits.

**Unit Testing Suggestions:**
- **add_embedding()**:

**Integration Testing Suggestions:**
- Create comprehensive performance tests comparing quantized vs. regular storage across various dataset sizes
- Test API compatibility with existing performance test suites and legacy code
- Validate end-to-end workflows: add embeddings → auto-quantize → search → verify results
- Benchmark memory savings and search speed improvements with real-world embedding datasets
