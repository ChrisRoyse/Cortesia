## File Analysis: ./src/storage/bloom.rs

### 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Primary Role:** Probabilistic Data Structure - Bloom Filter implementation for fast membership testing

**Summary:** This file implements both standard and counting Bloom filters, providing space-efficient probabilistic data structures for testing set membership with controllable false positive rates.

**Key Components:**

- **BloomFilter::new**: Creates a new Bloom filter with optimal parameters based on expected items and desired false positive rate. Takes expected item count and false positive rate as inputs, returns a configured BloomFilter instance.

- **BloomFilter::insert**: Adds an item to the bloom filter by setting multiple bit positions. Takes any hashable item as input, modifies internal bit array with no return value.

- **BloomFilter::contains**: Tests whether an item might be in the set. Takes a hashable item as input, returns boolean (true = possibly in set, false = definitely not in set).

- **BloomFilter::optimal_bit_count/optimal_hash_count**: Calculate optimal parameters for the filter. Take item count and false positive rate/bit count as inputs, return optimal sizes for efficiency.

- **CountingBloomFilter**: Extended version supporting item removal using counters instead of bits. Maintains counts per bucket allowing decrement operations.

### 2. Project Relevance and Dependencies

**Architectural Role:** Serves as a fast pre-filter in the knowledge graph system to quickly eliminate non-existent entities before more expensive lookups. Essential for optimizing query performance in large-scale graph operations.

## Directory Summary: ./src/storage/ (Part 1)

**Overall Purpose and Role:** These four files form the foundation of the storage layer, providing complementary data structures for different aspects of the knowledge graph: membership testing (Bloom), graph topology (CSR), exact vector search (Flat), and approximate vector search (HNSW).

**Core Files:** 
1. **csr.rs** - Most critical for graph structure storage, providing the backbone for relationship data
2. **hnsw.rs** - Essential for scalable semantic search capabilities
3. **flat_index.rs** - Baseline for exact search and small-scale operations

**Interaction Patterns:** These structures are typically used in combination:
- Bloom filters pre-filter entity existence checks before CSR graph lookups
- Flat index handles small-scale exact searches while HNSW scales to millions
- CSR provides topology while vector indices enable semantic queries

**Directory-Wide Testing Strategy:** 
- Create unified benchmark suite comparing all structures on common operations
- Implement integration tests combining Bloom pre-filtering with CSR traversal
- Test memory usage patterns under various workload distributions
- Verify thread-safety across all structures with concurrent stress tests
