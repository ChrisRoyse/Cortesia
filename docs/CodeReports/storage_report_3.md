### 2. Project Relevance and Dependencies

**Architectural Role:** Provides the highest-performance storage backend for scenarios where data fits in memory and read performance is critical. The zero-copy design and cache-aware layout enable microsecond-latency operations at scale.

**Dependencies:**
- **Imports:**
  - `crate::core::types::{CompactEntity, NeighborSlice}`: Domain types optimized for memory layout

### 3. Testing Strategy

**Overall Approach:** Test performance characteristics, memory efficiency, and safety of unsafe operations. Focus on cache behavior and concurrent access patterns. Unit tests that need private access should be placed in `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source files, while integration tests should only test public APIs and remain in the `tests/` directory.

**Test Placement Rules:**
- **Unit Tests:** Tests that need access to private methods/fields must be in `#[cfg(test)]` modules within the source file (`src/storage/mmap_storage.rs`)
- **Integration Tests:** Tests that only use public APIs should be in separate test files (`tests/storage/test_mmap_storage.rs`)
- **Property Tests:** Tests that verify invariants and mathematical properties
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmarks for critical path operations

**Unit Testing Suggestions (place in `src/storage/mmap_storage.rs`):**

- **Zero-copy operations:**
  - Happy Path: Verify get_neighbors_unchecked returns correct data
  - Edge Cases: Boundary checks, empty neighbor lists
  - Error Handling: Invalid entity IDs, out-of-bounds access

- **Batch operations:**
  - Happy Path: Batch lookups match individual lookups
  - Edge Cases: Empty batches, duplicate IDs
  - Error Handling: Mixed valid/invalid IDs

- **Memory efficiency:**
  - Happy Path: Verify memory usage matches expected values
