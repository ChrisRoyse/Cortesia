## Part 1: Individual File Analysis

### File Analysis: `mod.rs`

**1. Purpose and Functionality**

- **Primary Role:** Module orchestrator and main MCP server implementation
- **Summary:** This file serves as the central hub for the MCP module, exposing a comprehensive knowledge graph MCP server (`LLMKGMCPServer`) with graph RAG capabilities, embedding management, and performance tracking.

**Key Components:**
- **LLMKGMCPServer**: Main MCP server struct that orchestrates GraphRAGEngine, embedding cache, batch processor, performance stats, and memory-mapped storage
- **PerformanceStats**: Tracks operational metrics including query counts, response times, cache hits/misses, and entity/relationship processing counts
- **get_tools()**: Returns a comprehensive set of 5 MCP tools (knowledge_search, entity_lookup, find_connections, expand_concept, graph_statistics)
- **handle_request()**: Central request dispatcher that routes to specific handler methods based on tool name
- **handle_knowledge_search()**: Core search functionality using GraphRAG engine with embedding-based retrieval
- **handle_entity_lookup()**: Entity search by ID or natural language description
- **handle_find_connections()**: Relationship path finding between entities (placeholder implementation)
- **handle_expand_concept()**: Concept expansion using embeddings and GraphRAG (fully implemented)
- **handle_graph_statistics()**: Returns comprehensive system statistics
- **get_embedding_for_text()**: Embedding generation with caching mechanism
- **create_simple_embedding()**: Hash-based embedding for demonstration (production would use real models)

**2. Project Relevance and Dependencies**

- **Architectural Role:** This is the primary entry point for external LLM interactions with the knowledge graph system. It provides a standardized MCP interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying graph operations.

**Dependencies:**
- **Imports:** GraphRAGEngine (core retrieval), BatchProcessor (SIMD search), MMapStorage (memory-mapped storage), shared MCP types, error handling
- **Exports:** The main server struct and shared types are re-exported for use by other modules

**3. Testing Strategy**

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Organization
**Status**: Tests need to be organized according to Rust testing best practices

**Identified Issues**:
- Main MCP server requires both unit tests for private methods and integration tests for public API
- Complex internal state management needs private access testing
- Public MCP protocol compliance requires integration testing

### Test Placement Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Tests requiring private access → `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source file (`src/mcp/mod.rs`)
- **Integration Tests**: Public API only → separate files (`tests/mcp/test_mod.rs`)
- **Property Tests**: Mathematical invariants and behavioral verification
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for critical operations

### Test Placement Violations
**CRITICAL**: Integration tests must NEVER access private methods or fields. Tests violating this rule must be moved to unit tests in source files.

### Unit Testing Suggestions (place in `src/mcp/mod.rs`)
- **Happy Path:** Test each handler method with valid inputs (knowledge_search with valid query, entity_lookup with existing entity)
- **Edge Cases:** Empty queries, non-existent entities, invalid parameters, memory limits, cache behavior
- **Error Handling:** Network failures, embedding generation failures, GraphRAG engine errors
- **Private method testing:** Internal cache management, performance stats updates, embedding generation

### Integration Testing Suggestions (place in `tests/mcp/test_mod.rs`)
- **End-to-end MCP workflow:** Create request → handle_request → verify response format and content
- **Performance monitoring:** Verify statistics are updated correctly across multiple operations
- **Cache integration:** Test embedding cache hit/miss scenarios with the BatchProcessor
- **MCP protocol compliance:** Verify all responses match MCP specification

**2. Project Relevance and Dependencies**

- **Architectural Role:** Provides the foundational data structures that enable communication between LLMs and the knowledge graph system. Acts as the interface contract for all MCP operations.

**Dependencies:**
- **Imports:** serde for serialization/deserialization
- **Exports:** All types are public and used throughout the MCP module ecosystem

**3. Testing Strategy**

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Organization
**Status**: Type definitions primarily need unit testing for serialization/deserialization

**Identified Issues**:
- Serialization/deserialization logic requires comprehensive testing
- Type validation needs private access for internal validation methods
- Cross-module compatibility testing requires integration tests

### Test Placement Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Tests requiring private access → `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source file (`src/mcp/shared_types.rs`)
- **Integration Tests**: Public API only → separate files (`tests/mcp/test_shared_types.rs`)
- **Property Tests**: Mathematical invariants and behavioral verification
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for critical operations

### Test Placement Violations
**CRITICAL**: Integration tests must NEVER access private methods or fields. Tests violating this rule must be moved to unit tests in source files.

### Unit Testing Suggestions (place in `src/mcp/shared_types.rs`)
- **Happy Path:** Serialize and deserialize all struct types with typical data
- **Edge Cases:** Empty fields, very large strings, null values, malformed JSON schemas
- **Error Handling:** Invalid JSON, missing required fields, type mismatches
- **Private validation:** Internal validation methods and constraint checking

### Integration Testing Suggestions (place in `tests/mcp/test_shared_types.rs`)
- **Cross-module compatibility:** Ensure types work correctly with actual MCP server implementations
- **JSON schema validation:** Verify that tool input schemas properly validate real tool usage
- **Protocol compliance:** Verify types match MCP specification requirements
