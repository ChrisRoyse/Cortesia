# LLMKG Comprehensive Simulation & Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive 6-phase plan to implement an exhaustive simulation environment for the LLMKG (LLM Knowledge Graph) system. The plan ensures complete test coverage across all components, features, and use cases through synthetic data generation, deterministic outcomes, and rigorous validation.

## Project Overview

**LLMKG** is a high-performance, Rust-based knowledge graph system optimized for LLM integration. The simulation plan will create a controlled environment to test every aspect of the system with known, deterministic outcomes.

### Core Features to Test:
- **Knowledge Graph Operations**: Entity management, relationship traversal, CSR storage
- **Vector Similarity Search**: SIMD-accelerated embedding operations with quantization
- **Graph RAG Engine**: Retrieval-augmented generation with context assembly
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol tool integration
- **Federation**: Multi-database coordination and query routing
- **Memory Management**: Epoch-based lock-free operations
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond query times, compression ratios
- **WebAssembly**: Browser/Node.js deployment scenarios
- **Streaming**: Real-time updates and incremental indexing

## Testing Philosophy

### Deterministic Testing Approach
1. **Synthetic Data with Known Properties**: Generate controlled datasets where outcomes are mathematically predictable
2. **Golden Standard Validation**: Compare all results against pre-computed expected values
3. **Exhaustive Coverage**: Test every code path, edge case, and feature combination
4. **Performance Verification**: Validate all performance claims under controlled conditions
5. **Multi-Environment Testing**: Native Rust, WebAssembly, and MCP contexts

### Success Criteria
- **100% Code Coverage**: Every line of code executed during testing
- **100% Feature Coverage**: Every documented feature validated
- **Performance Compliance**: All performance targets met under test conditions
- **Deterministic Results**: All tests produce identical, predictable outcomes
- **Zero Regression**: New changes don't break existing functionality
