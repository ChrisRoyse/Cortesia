# LLMKG Human-Like Memory System - Master Implementation Plan

## Vision
Transform LLMKG from a static knowledge graph into a dynamic, associative memory system that mimics human cognitive processes including episodic memory, semantic networks, emotional tagging, and temporal evolution.

## Implementation Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Weeks 1-4)

- Priority: HIGH
- Dependencies: Phase 1

### Phase 3: Associative Memory Networks (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal**: Build spreading activation, context-aware retrieval, and pattern completion

- Priority: MEDIUM
- Dependencies: Phase 4

### Phase 6: Emotional & Metacognitive (Weeks 21-24)
**Goal**: Add emotional tagging, importance weighting, and metacognitive monitoring
- [Detailed Plan](./06_PHASE_EMOTIONAL_METACOGNITIVE.md)
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Dependencies: Phase 5

### Phase 7: Creative & Predictive (Weeks 25-28)
**Goal**: Implement divergent thinking, creative recombination, and predictive modeling
- [Detailed Plan](./07_PHASE_CREATIVE_PREDICTIVE.md)
- Priority: LOW
- Dependencies: Phase 6

### Phase 8: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 29-32)
**Goal**: System integration, performance optimization, and production readiness
- [Detailed Plan](./08_PHASE_INTEGRATION_OPTIMIZATION.md)
- Priority: HIGH
- Dependencies: All phases

## Key Principles

### 1. Incremental Development
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Continuous testing and validation
- Regular performance benchmarking

### 2. Human Cognitive Modeling
- Based on cognitive psychology research
- Mimics actual human memory processes
- Balances accuracy with computational efficiency

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing API structure
- Enhance without breaking current functionality
- Provide migration paths for existing data

### 4. Scalability First
- Design for millions of memories
- Efficient algorithms and data structures
- Distributed processing capabilities

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Entity extraction accuracy > 95%
- Question answering relevance > 85%
- Associative retrieval precision > 80%
- Memory decay modeling accuracy > 90%
- Query response time < 100ms

### Cognitive Metrics
- Passes cognitive memory tests
- Demonstrates human-like forgetting curves
- Shows context-dependent retrieval
- Exhibits priming effects
- Generates creative associations

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance degradation**: Mitigate with careful optimization and caching
2. **Memory bloat**: Implement efficient pruning and consolidation
3. **Complex dependencies**: Use modular architecture

### Implementation Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to phase boundaries
2. **Integration challenges**: Continuous integration testing
3. **Breaking changes**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Senior Rust developers
- 1 NLP/ML specialist
- 1 Cognitive scientist advisor
- 1 DevOps engineer

### Infrastructure
- Development environment with GPU support
- CI/CD pipeline
- Performance testing infrastructure
- Production-ready deployment platform

## Timeline Summary
- **Total Duration**: 32 weeks (8 months)
- **MVP Ready**: Week 16 (after Phase 4)
- **Full System**: Week 32
- **Production Deployment**: Week 36 (with 4 weeks buffer)

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve Phase 1 plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create project tracking system
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
